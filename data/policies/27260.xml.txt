Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting"><p>The annual <em>Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,</em> signed by deputy heads and their chief financial officers, accompanies the financial statements that are linked to, and published concurrently with, Departmental Performance Reports. </p><p>The Statement acknowledges management’s responsibility for maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting. It also refers to the annual assessment of the effectiveness of this system, conducted by management, along with the associated action plan for the next and subsequent fiscal years. As required by the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15258"><em>Policy on Internal Control</em></a>, a summary of the assessment and action plan is to be annexed to the Statement, excluding departments that have undergone a core control audit.</p><p>Templates for the Statement can be found in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18830"><em>Treasury Board Accounting Standard 1.2 – Departmental and Agency Financial Statements</em></a>. Two templates are provided—one for departments not subject to core control audits and one for small departments subject to core control audits. Some parts of the
            templates can be customized.</p><p>The template for departments subject to core control audits makes a distinction between departments where a core control audit has taken place and departments where one has not. If a core control audit has taken place, the Statement should reference the audit report and the related action plan. Because these documents are deemed to provide appropriate disclosure of internal control
            management, an annex is not required and the reference to it has been removed.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Overview of the Annex to the Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting"><p>The annex to the Statement provides users of financial statements with summary information that demonstrates how well the departmental system of internal control over financial reporting is being managed through annual assessments and associated action plans. In the annex templates provided in this guideline, the expected content in previous annexes has been streamlined to reduce
            reporting burden.</p><p>It is understood that based on departmental size, complexity, risk, capacity, decentralization and other pertinent factors, the implementation and completion of the first full assessment of  key controls can take place over multiple years. The <em>Policy on Internal Control</em> recognizes these differences, and flexibility is provided for departments to take a multi-year approach
            to the assessment of their system of internal control over financial reporting. </p><h3>Internal Control Management</h3><p>Beginning in 2013-14,<sup><a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[2]</a></sup> departments completing the standard annex are to include, in Section 2.1, a summary of the measures being taken to effectively manage departmental internal controls. Internal control management includes activities to ensure that key internal controls are assessed and periodically reassessed on a risk-basis and
            for monitoring purposes; corrective actions are being taken when necessary; and formal oversight of those activities takes place through effective governance, including the establishment of an internal control management framework and regular reporting to senior management, the deputy head and the departmental audit committee. </p><p>Generally, an internal control management framework, approved by the deputy head, establishes the tone from the top and how effective internal control management will be practised in the department. The framework may include such elements as governance structure, roles and responsibilities for the management of internal controls, internal control measures in the performance management
            agreements of senior managers, an internal control management focus group under the chief financial officer, and annual validations of internal control management results (for example, requiring program assistant deputy ministers to sign off on controls management in their program areas).</p><p>Section 2 of the annex should also include the membership of the departmental audit committee, as well as the frequency and focus of its meetings.</p><p>Examples of language for internal control management, which may be adapted to reflect departmental practices, are found in Appendix A.</p><h3>Status of Assessment</h3><p>Departments publish their annexes on a fiscal year basis. Annexes provide an opportunity for departments to highlight not only the effectiveness of their management of internal controls but also the status of their assessment efforts. In this way, departments leverage and demonstrate the progress achieved since the prior year’s annex. Departments are expected to provide a high-level
            picture of the overall status of the full assessment process—what has been achieved to date and what still needs to be achieved to complete the full assessment of all key controls and control areas. Once the first full assessment has been completed, the organization’s annex should reflect the ongoing monitoring stage, as indicated in Scenario B of Appendix A.</p><p>The links to published annexes and other useful information on the implementation of the <em>Policy on Internal Control</em> and the assessment process can be found at <a href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/PIC">PIC GCPedia</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Policy Statement"><p>The format and the content of annex templates in published annexes up to 2011-12 have been streamlined to reduce reporting burden. Departments are encouraged to use the annex template appropriate to the department’s circumstances and to adapt, as necessary, the level of detail, content and key messages. </p><p>A department newly subject to the <em>Policy on Internal Control</em>, such as a new government department, should contact the Office of the Comptroller General for guidance on policy requirements and on the development of an inaugural annex.</p><p>The two types of common annexes are:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#appA">Standard annex for departments not subject to core control audits</a></strong>: This annex is to be used by departments that have already started the assessment process under the <em>Policy on Internal Control</em> and have completed an annex for the previous fiscal year. The focus of this annex is the
                    progress achieved since the prior fiscal year. It should be noted that departments can progress through the assessment of the control areas at different rates. That is, certain control areas can start a program of ongoing monitoring ahead of other areas, which would be reflected in the results and in the status and action plan information. Appendix A provides examples of the annex both before and
                    after all the control areas have reached the ongoing monitoring stage.</li><li><strong><a href="#appB">Simplified annex for departments subject to core control audits</a></strong>: This annex is to be used by departments subject to core controls audits until such time as a core control audit has taken place. As the name implies, this annex is a simpler version of the standard annex and has been
                    significantly amended to reflect the expectations for departments subject to core control audits, as described in Section 6.  </li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. The Secretariat’s Expectations for Internal Control Management and Departmental Assessment Progress Reported in the Annex"><p>For greater clarity and transparency, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s expectations of departments for internal control management and assessment progress are detailed below. The expectations for departmental assessment progress, while generalized, take into account the high diversity of departments. As the Secretariat’s expectations mature over time, they will be
            periodically updated and communicated to departments.</p><h3>Internal Control Management</h3><p>Large departments have reached a general state of maturity in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Senior departmental management is expected to remain committed to the sound management of its system of internal control over financial reporting, as demonstrated through the conduct of the department’s annual risk-based assessments. To support the assessment efforts
            and management commitment, departments will be expected to have in place a formalized internal control management framework, approved by the deputy head, that identifies such elements as internal control governance, accountabilities, measures in the performance management agreements of senior management, and any other key measures used by the department to manage internal controls.</p><p>Beginning with the 2013-14 annexes, a new section has been added to the standard annex for departments to summarize their departmental internal control management practices. </p><p>Departments subject to core control audits will be expected to have in place, at a minimum, a framework with appropriate oversight and focus on the ongoing performance of their core controls and any related measures to mitigate additional key financial risks to their department.</p><h3>Assessment Progress</h3><p>The three-year implementation of the <em>Policy on Internal Control</em><sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[3]</a></sup> was completed with the publication of the 2011-12 financial statements and associated annexes. Many departments have been assessing their system of internal control for multiple years. With the publication of each subsequent annex, departments are expected to
            demonstrate reasonable assessment progress across all control areas (for example, entity-level controls, information technology [IT] general controls, and key business processes). Assessment progress relates to the movement from the documentation of key controls, through design and operating effectiveness testing, to the full ongoing monitoring stage.</p><p>Key factors that may influence the pace of progress and thus the overall departmental maturity of internal control management include:</p><ul><li>Complexity of mandate;</li><li>Nature and complexity of key financial accounts and related risks;</li><li>Nature and extent of decentralization;</li><li>Nature of service arrangements with other government departments; and</li><li>Capacity.</li></ul><p>The Secretariat’s expectations for departmental maturity in assessment progress, as reported in the annex, are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Cluster I (22 departments):</strong> Cluster I departments started assessing their system of internal control under the Audited Financial Statements Initiative that began in 2004, prior to the <em>Policy on Internal Control</em>. As a result, by the end of 2012-13, these 22 departments were expected to be nearing completion of
                    operating effectiveness testing and ideally to be fully into the ongoing monitoring stage. </li><li><strong>Cluster II (17 departments not subject to core control audits):</strong> Because their departmental financial statements are audited, Cluster II departments are also expected to be advanced in operating effectiveness testing and possibly into the ongoing monitoring stage in some control areas.</li><li><strong>Cluster III (12 departments not subject to core control audits):</strong> By the end of 2012–13, Cluster III departments were expected to be advanced in design effectiveness testing in some or all control areas, as applicable, and to have possibly started operating effectiveness testing in some control areas. </li><li><strong>Departments subject to core control audits (46 departments):</strong> Departments subject to core control audits are expected to ensure that their financial transaction controls (sections 32 to 34 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>) continue to perform as expected. In addition, these departments are expected to take
                    appropriate measures to monitor other risk areas pertinent to their departmental system of internal control. Progress is reviewed through periodic audits of core controls and is sustained through departmental management oversight.</li></ul></chapter></chapters><appendices><appendix anchor="A" title="Appendix A: Example of a Standard Annex, for Departments Not Subject to Core Control Audits"><p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong></p><ol><li><em>Sections 1 and 2 of this annex apply to all departments.
