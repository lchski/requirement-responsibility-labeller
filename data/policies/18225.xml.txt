		This policy is a significant change in how government carries out investment
		planning. As a result, Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) has adopted a phased
		implementation approach that began with a group of departments that agreed to
		participate in an 18-month pilot. Following this pilot, groups of departments
		will be brought on board so that, by April 1, 2012, all departments and agencies will have the systems and processes in place to meet the policy requirements. 
		In addition, based on lessons learned through the pilot, amendments to the<em>

<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/fra/lois/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>, unless specific acts or regulations override it.</p><p>2.2 The provisions in sections
6.2.2 and 7.1 relating to the role of the Treasury Board Secretariat in
monitoring compliance and directing measures to be taken in response to
non-compliance do not apply with respect to the Office of the Auditor General,
the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Office of the Information
Commissioner, the Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, the Office of the
Commissioner of Lobbying, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages

allocating and reallocating resources to new and existing assets and acquired services
that are essential to program delivery. Departmental investment planning is a
key element in achieving value for money and sound stewardship.</p><p>3.2 Effective investment planning ensures resources are
allocated in a manner that clearly supports program outcomes and government
priorities, and is characterized as being:</p><ul><li>Essential and responsive to government priorities and effective program delivery;</li><li>Affordable, productive and financially sustainable;</li><li>Reflective of an appropriate balance of risk, benefits and return between the Crown and third parties;</li><li>Safe, secure and compliant with relevant laws, regulations and policies, and codes of conduct;</li><li>Protective of Canadian heritage and the environment;</li><li>Reflective of departmental, portfolio, horizontal and government-wide perspective while taking into account strategic government-wide initiatives, as appropriate.</li></ul><p>3.3 Investments in assets and acquired services have
significant strategic, public policy, operational, risk and financial
implications. Investment planning is founded in an effective regime for
planning, decision-making and governance. It underpins a department's ability to manage investments of highest priority and greatest risk to the government.</p><p>3.4 Deputy heads are responsible for the effective management
of the investment planning function within their departments.  Effective
management includes developing a departmental investment plan, exercising
oversight in the implementation of the investment decisions and ensuring
appropriate, ongoing measurement of investment performance. This responsibility
will include the provision of ongoing advice to ministers on their investment
plans, prior to Treasury Board consideration and at least annually thereafter.  This advice
would flag substantive changes if any, affecting content, capacity,
performance, resource allocation and/or the requirement for Treasury Board approvals.  </p><p>3.5 This policy is issued pursuant to section 7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/fra/lois/F-11/"><em>Financial
Administration Act</em></a>.</p><p>3.6 This policy reflects the principles set out in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12022"><em>Policy
Framework for the Management of Assets and Acquired Services</em></a> and is implemented in conjunction with related
Treasury Board policies governing assets and acquired services. These include
the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229"><em>Policy on the Management of Projects</em></a>, the
<em>Policy on Managing Procurement</em>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042"><em>Policy

reference levels.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Expected results"><p>Investment planning supports departmental, portfolio,

high-level strategic document that defines the direction, capacity and
commitments of a department with respect to its investment in assets and
acquired services. The plan must clearly set out departmental priorities and
strategies for the upcoming five-year period, and outline a three-year
investment function that meets the needs of the department within available
resources<strong>. </strong> Plans must also include sufficient information on planned
projects to support an informed decision by Treasury Board Ministers as to
which projects would warrant their consideration over the planning horizon.</p><p>The investment plan must demonstrate that a
strong regime for planning, decision-making and governance exists, which is the
basis for Treasury Board approval of a department's expenditure authority.
Departments need to demonstrate investment planning capacity and the risk and
complexity of investment-based projects within the investment period.</p><p>A good investment plan must, at a minimum,
cover the following representative categories of information.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A series of statements addressing the
purpose, scope and objectives of planned investments.</p><h3>Departmental context</h3><ul><li>An explanation of the department's mandate, including relevant historical data, and the contribution of investments and acquired
	services to program outcomes.</li><li>High-level profile of the existing portfolios of
	assets and acquired services in support of program activity, including asset
	value and an assessment of responsiveness to requirements (i.e., issues, risks
	and opportunities).</li></ul><h3>Direction, Capacity and Commitment</h3><ul><li>An assessment of previously planned investments
	against intended results, including an overview of lessons learned, challenges
	to and opportunities for improving elements of the investment planning
	framework and organizational planning and resourcing capacity.</li><li>Demonstration of the planning framework,
	including: governance structures and processes for planning, approving and
	resourcing investments; priority determination criteria and process;
	integration of information systems; and a description of controls and
	monitoring regime.</li><li>Description of the planning cycle, including
	linkage to the department's strategic planning.</li><li>The presentation of key departmental priorities
	and strategies over a five-year investment horizon demonstrating consideration
	of portfolio, horizontal and government-wide objectives and priorities, as well
	as a clear link to departmental program activities and outcomes.</li><li>An explanation of the department's risk management approach to investment planning, including the identification of areas of
	greatest risk to program integrity, risk mitigation strategies and residual
	risk.</li></ul><p>Descriptive information is provided on
planned investments with elaboration for those investments in assets or
acquired services deemed to have significant strategic, public policy,
operational, risk and financial implications for the department. Each planned
investment, at a minimum, outlines: the total estimated cost of the investment,
investment or procurement strategies, including the result of the P3 screen, when applied in accordance with this policy, and opportunities for achieving broader
government objectives. Project investments need to be listed in a summary table
consistent with the Standard for Organizational Project Management Capacity and
the Standard for Project Complexity and Risk.</p><p>Information on the impacts of the proposed
investment function is included and should detail:</p><ul><li>The existing portfolios of assets and services,
	addressing performance improvement, as well as gaps, trade-offs and residual
	risks;</li><li>The intended, broader short-, middle- and
	long-term ability of the department to achieve outputs and outcomes; and</li><li>External clients and stakeholders, other
	government departments, and the federal government as a whole.</li></ul><p>An overview of relevant financial
information that covers the department's planned allocation and reallocation of
existing reference levels to refresh and sustain existing assets and services
is required. The overview is also required to fund new investments. The
financial information is to be presented from the most appropriate perspectives
including, but not limited to, by investment class and by program activity.</p></appendix></appendices><footnotes><footnote anchor="fn1" reference="fnr1" title="*" tooltip="Back to Footnote 1 Reference">
