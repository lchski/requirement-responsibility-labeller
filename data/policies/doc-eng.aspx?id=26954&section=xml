    Process 3.2), Pay Administration (Business Process 5.1), and Manage Grants and Contributions (Business Process 6.1). This guideline describes roles, responsibilities and recommended procedures in the context of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (FAA), other legislation, and Government of Canada policy instruments. Familiarity with Manage Procure to Payment (Business Process 3.1) is highly
    recommended prior to reading this business process. </p><p>The following categories of common payment transactions are covered in this guideline.</p><p><strong>Other operational payments</strong> result in charges against appropriations and include awards, honoraria, <em>ex gratia</em> payments, repayable loans, employee reimbursements, returns as described in section 20 of the FAA, accountable advances (excluding travel advances, which are covered in Manage Travel (Business Process 3.2)), and imprest funds. These payments do not use a
    purchase order to initiate a transaction and do not follow a formal procurement process.</p><p><strong>Legal payments</strong> also result in charges against appropriations and include settlements, claims against the Crown, and nugatory payments. These transactions are triggered by a court or a tribunal decision rather than by a program requirement. Because these transactions do not involve the acquisition of goods or services, there is no procurement process. A legal opinion and
    documentation, such as the copy of the court or tribunal decision, are required before the payment can be made.</p><p><strong>Payments not impacting appropriations</strong> are made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and include garnishments, other deductions, remittances of taxes collected, payments against imprest funds, repayment of contractor holdbacks, and some types of payments against specified purpose accounts.<sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3" name="ftnref3"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[3]</a></sup> Although these transactions do not result in charges against appropriations and there is no acquisition of goods or services, FAA certification and payment authority are still required.</p><p><strong>Periodic payments</strong> are recurring (usually monthly) payments resulting from a multi-year agreement established under Manage Procure to Payment (Business Process 3.1), starting with the second and subsequent payments of the agreement. These payments can be a fixed amount (for example, leases and rent) or usage-based (for example, telecommunications, utilities and taxis) and
    result in charges against appropriations. There is no need to identify the requirements or to obtain expenditure initiation authority. Some organizations may conduct a reallocation exercise, to ensure that the costs are properly attributed to responsibility centres.</p><p>As illustrated in Figure 1, Manage Other Payments comprises seven subprocesses (3.3.1 to 3.3.7). These are arranged in four subprocess groups, as follows.</p><p><strong>Manage Requirements</strong> is the start of the Manage Other Payments business process and involves the definition of requirements, prepared by an employee or the responsibility centre manager, and the determination and exercising of expenditure initiation authority. This subprocess group applies to other operational payments and legal payments.</p><p><strong>Control Commitments</strong> involves verifying the availability of a sufficient unencumbered balance and creating and updating commitments according to department-specific policy or procedures. Responsibility centre managers are accountable for monitoring commitments against their budget. Control Commitments connects to two subprocesses groups: Manage Requirements, to create the
    commitment; and Manage Payables, to ensure that sufficient unencumbered funds are available before proceeding with the payment, and to close the commitment once the final request for payment has been issued. This subprocess group applies to other operational payments, legal payments and periodic payments.</p><p><strong>Manage Payables</strong> involves handling invoices, claims, agreements, remittances or deduction requests; performing account verification; and providing certification authority pursuant to section 34 of the FAA. This subprocess group applies to all four categories of payments. Normally, the responsibility centre manager performs account verification and certification. However, for
    some non-pay employee-related payments, these activities may be performed by the compensation role and, for legal payments and payments not impacting appropriations, by financial services.</p><p><strong>Manage Payments</strong> ends the Manage Other Payments business process and involves performing quality assurance activities when applicable, exercising payment authority pursuant to section 33 of the FAA, completing and submitting payment requisitions, and finalizing payments. When quality assurance is performed, the process flow continues to Manage Financial Close (Business Process
    8.2). When quality assurance is not performed, the process flow continues to Manage Post-Payment Verification (Business Process 8.1). Financial services is responsible for managing payment requisitions, certifying payments pursuant to section 33 of the FAA, and recording payments. The Banking and Cash Management Sector of the Receiver General is responsible for issuing payments. This subprocess
    applies to all four categories of payments.</p><p>Because not all subprocesses apply to all categories of payments, the payment categories have different entry points to the Manage Other Payments business process, as illustrated in Figure 1. In addition, the order in which Determine and Exercise Expenditure Initiation Authority (Subprocess 3.3.1), Verify Unencumbered Balance (Subprocess 3.3.3) and Manage Commitments (Subprocess 3.3.4) are
    performed may differ from what is depicted in Figure 1, depending on department-specific policy or procedures.</p><div id="ldr1" class="alignCenter"><p><em><strong>Figure 1.

Context"><p>This guideline is part of a set of guidelines designed to assist departments<sup><a href="#ftn4" id="ftnref4" name="ftnref4"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[4]</a></sup> in implementing common financial management business processes. This guideline supports the <em>Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</em> and the <em>Directive on the Stewardship of
    Financial Management Systems</em>.</p><p>This guideline presents the “should be” model for Manage Other Payments, describing roles, responsibilities and recommended activities from a financial management perspective. Most activities are financial in nature, but some non-financial activities are included in order to provide a comprehensive process description; these activities are identified as outside the scope of Manage
    Other Payments. The recommended activities comply with the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, other legislation, and Government of Canada policy instruments.</p><p>Recognizing that deputy heads are ultimately responsible for all aspects of financial management systems within their department, standardizing and streamlining financial management system configurations, business processes and data across government provides significant direct and indirect benefits relative to the quality of financial management in the Government of Canada. By establishing a
    common set of rules, standardization reduces the multitude of different systems, business processes and data that undermine the quality and cost of decision-making information. As government-wide standardization increases, efficiency, integrity and interoperability are improved.<sup><a href="#ftn5" id="ftnref5" name="ftnref5"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[5]</a></sup></p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3.

Other operational payments may be launched by a responsibility centre manager to disburse a monetary employee
        recognition award or a repayable loan established under an agreement. Alternatively, employees may submit a request to obtain an accountable advance or a reimbursement for expenses incurred—for example, for a professional development activity or for parking. Travel advances are outside the scope of this business process and are covered in Manage Travel (Business Process 3.2).</p><p>For some transactions, a consultation and a justification may be required when selecting a vendor <strong>(Activity 3.3.1.2 – Examine and Select Vendor)—</strong>for example, for employee reimbursements when the payee is the employee and the vendor is the third party selected by the employee. Although the payment is a reimbursement to an employee rather than to an external vendor,
        compliance with Treasury Board and departmental policies is still required.</p><p>The content of the justification varies with the type of transaction. The following are examples of the types of documentation required.</p><ul><li><strong>Accountable Advances:</strong>  Employees submit a request conforming to the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15789"><em>Directive on Accountable Advances</em></a><sup><a href="#ftn16" id="ftnref16" name="ftnref16"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[16]</a></sup> and other relevant policy instruments.</li><li><strong>Awards:</strong> A monetary award is supported by an awards plan and by a consultation with the other human resources management functions role, ensuring that the recognition is valid and appropriate.</li><li><strong>Reimbursements:</strong> For a reimbursement request related to training, learning or development, the supporting documentation should include an approved Personal Learning Plan. When the reimbursement is for hospitality, the request should be aligned with the annual budget and conform to the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=19855"><em>Directive on
                the Management of Expenditures on Travel, Hospitality and Conferences</em></a>. </li><li><strong>Repayable Loans:</strong> The posting assignment notice supports the request for a posting loan under <a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/fsd-dse-10/index-eng.php"><em>FSD-10 of the Foreign Service Directives</em></a><em>.</em> Other repayable loans, excluding repayable contributions, are triggered by a loan application received and
                approved by the program area. (Repayable contributions are covered in Manage Grants and Contributions (Business Process 6.1)). The approval of the loan occurs in the appropriate program area, whereas this business process focuses on the loan disbursement. The collection of the loan is covered in Manage Revenues, Receivables and Receipts (Business Process 2.1).</li></ul><h5>5.2.1.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>There are two potential scenarios for the activities of this subprocess. In the first scenario (S1), the employee initiates the transaction, as is the case with accountable advances and reimbursable expenses. In the second scenario (S2), the responsibility centre manager initiates the transaction. In both scenarios, the role initiating the transaction is responsible and accountable.</p><p>Table 3 provides an overview of roles and responsibilities, using the Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) approach.

All program, accounts payable and compensation
        payments are issued by the Receiver General on behalf of federal departments and are drawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.<sup><a href="#ftn62" id="ftnref62" name="ftnref62"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[62]</a></sup> The SPS is an integrated system, with various components and menus that incorporate the entire payment and document process.<sup><a href="#ftn63" id="ftnref63" name="ftnref63"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[63]</a></sup></p><p>The following summarizes the SPS payment processing steps.<sup><a href="#ftn64" id="ftnref64" name="ftnref64"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[64]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Edit and Verification:</strong> On receipt of the requisition and payment details, the SPS confirms the authenticity of the electronic signature on the requisition and then edits the input to ensure that the requisition and payment details match and show no signs of tampering.</p><p><strong>Assignment of Payment Reference Numbers:</strong> Each edited payment is assigned a 12-digit payment reference number (PRN) prior to loading into the SPS database. Each PRN is linked to the SPS requisition number assigned by the department.</p><p><strong>Notification to Departments:</strong> Departments receive notification by return file that their payments have been edited and loaded into the SPS. Departments record the payment details (PRN, payment date, etc.) in their own departmental financial management system for control and future reference purposes.</p><p><strong>Online Enquiry and Updates:</strong> Returned payments are recorded in the SPS. Departments are responsible for handling returned payments and may request the cancellation or the issuance of duplicate payments through the SPS. The SPS allows enquiries at all points of the payment life cycle.</p><p>Post-payment processing, including cheque replacement and exceptions, is part of Manage Financial Close (Business Process 8.2).</p><p>Departments receive notification by return file that their payments have been released by the SPS. Departments process the return payment file <strong>(Activity 3.3.7.2 – Process Return Payment File)</strong> and subsequently finalize and record the payment details (PRN, payment date, etc.) in their departmental financial management system <strong>(Activity 3.3.7.3 – Finalize
        Payment)</strong>. Manage Other Payments (Business Process 3.3) ends, and Manage Post-Payment Verification (Business Process 8.1) or Manage Financial Close (Business Process 8.2) begins, depending on whether quality assurance is performed.</p><p>Departments are required to regularly reconcile the payment requisitions submitted to the SPS with the payment return or notification file sent by the SPS. Departments are also required to regularly reconcile the control account balances in the departmental financial and materiel management system with the control account totals received daily from the Receiver General – General Ledger
        (RG-GL), based on control data received from the SPS. Control account balance reconciliation is part of Manage Financial Close (Business Process 8.2).</p><p>At this point in the process, all payments are treated the same by the Receiver General; there are no differences between the payment categories.</p><h5>5.5.2.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>Financial services are responsible for recording completed payments, and the Banking and Cash Management Sector of the Receiver General is responsible for issuing payments.</p><p>Table 16 provides an overview of roles and responsibilities, using the Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) approach.

Manage Payments for Employee Relocation – Level 2 Process Flow</a></p></div><p>Manage Payments for Employee Relocation begins with an approved letter of offer or equivalent identifying the requirement for the employee to relocate for the position. The document can also take the form of a posting notice, a secondment, or another type of agreement requiring relocation. The possibility of relocation should be considered when initiating a staffing action and obtaining
        approval for the letter of offer. This activity is covered in the <em>Common Human Resource Business Process,</em><a href="http://chrbp-pocrh.tbs-sct.gc.ca/processMap-eng.aspx?processID=3.0&amp;path=">3.0 “Staffing and Employee Integration</a>.”</p><p><strong>Open Relocation File With Contracted Relocation Service Provider (CRSP)(Subprocess 3.3.10):</strong> The employee provides a copy of the signed letter of offer to the relocation coordinator. The relocation coordinator provides written authorization to the CRSP to provide contracted relocation services to the employee referred,<sup><a href="#ftn136" id="ftnref136" name="ftnref136"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[136]</a></sup> thereby initiating the file and exercising transaction authority, the third element of spending authority. Once the file is created, the employee provides additional data directly to the contracted relocation service provider so that a financial worksheet can be prepared.</p><p>The contracted relocation service provider is responsible for conducting all relocation activities (for example, accountable advances, travel, house hunting, temporary accommodations) and for preparing and submitting related expense claims. The contracted relocation service provider is also responsible for ensuring that all activities conform to the <a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/index.php?did=6&amp;lang=eng"><em>National Joint Council (NJC) Relocation Directive</em></a> as well as to the other references noted in this appendix. The policy instruments identify when further approval is required from the responsibility centre manager, the departmental relocation coordinator or the national departmental coordinator. The activities
        conducted by the contracted relocation service provider are outside the scope of the Manage Other Payments business process. Until the relocation file is closed, the supporting documents remain with the contracted relocation services provider. The file, including the original receipts, is sent to the department only when the file is closed.</p><p><strong>Manage Payables (Subprocess 3.3.5):</strong> Invoices are sent to departments by the Central Removal Service of Public Works and Government Services Canada or the contracted relocation service provider or, as is the case for National Defence (DND) and the RCMP, the moving company. In the case of DND and the RCMP, the invoice is verified and certified pursuant to section 34 of the FAA by
        the responsibility centre manager or the departmental relocation coordinator.</p><p>For removal of household goods, the contracted relocation service provider provides the departmental relocation coordinator with the required documentation. The departmental relocation coordinator then notifies the Central Removal Service. The Central Removal Service invoices the department directly, and the invoice is paid through interdepartmental settlement. These activities are performed
        during Manage Interdepartmental Settlements (Business Process 2.2).</p><p>Air or train travel booked with travel authority numbers (TANs) and charged to the departmental travel expense account is processed during Manage Travel (Business Process 3.2).</p><p>The contracted relocation service provider invoices the department directly for services rendered. Invoicing is typically done in three instalments: the first two invoices are pre-billings and the third invoice is the final bill. The final bill includes all relocation costs incurred less advances received. A summary of relocation costs with documentation is attached to the invoice.</p><p>Account verification and certification of the invoice pursuant to section 34 of the FAA is performed by the responsibility centre manager or by the departmental relocation coordinator, when the authority has been delegated. When the responsibility centre manager performs account verification, he or she may consult with the departmental relocation coordinator regarding the directive and the
        specifics of the relocation. When advances exceed the actual cost of the relocation, a refund cheque from the contracted relocation service provider is attached to the summary. The cheque is recorded as a cash receipt. These activities are performed during Manage Revenue, Receivables and Receipts (Business Process 2.1). </p><p>Occasionally, an employee is overpaid and the overpayment needs to be recovered. The employee is invoiced, and the overpayment is collected. These activities are also performed during Manage Revenue, Receivables and Receipts (Business Process 2.1).</p><p><strong>Perform Payment Authority (Subprocess 3.3.6):</strong> This subprocess starts with the receipt of a request for payment. Quality assurance may be performed by financial services as part of the payment authorization process pursuant to section 33 of the FAA. Typically, a relocation invoice is considered as a high-risk transaction.</p><p><strong>Issue Payment (Subprocess 3.3.7):</strong> After payment is authorized pursuant to section 33 of the FAA, the payment requisition is sent to the Receiver General for payment issuance. The payment requisition files are edited and validated, and the payments are released by the Receiver General. The Receiver General produces a generic return file containing unique payment references for
        control purposes. The payment records are updated in the departmental financial and materiel management system<sup><a href="#ftn137" id="ftnref137" name="ftnref137"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[137]</a></sup> by financial services, signalling the end of Manage Other Payments (Business Process 3.3) and the start of Manage Post-Payment Verification (Business Process 8.1) or Manage Financial Close (Business Process
