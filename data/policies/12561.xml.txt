Objective"><p>To prevent illness, injury and disability arising out of, or aggravated by, conditions of work.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Purpose and Scope"><p>2.1 The health of employees and candidates is evaluated to:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>establish that employees are able to continue working without detriment to their health or safety or that of others;</li><li>establish that candidates are able to meet the health requirements of the job prior to appointment;</li><li>in the case of postings, assess if individuals or their dependants have a health condition that may require resolution 
prior to posting, ongoing medical attention during posting or possible evacuation at posting;</li><li>establish the conditions under which employees with illnesses, injuries or disabilities are able to continue working.</li></ol><p>2.2 Generally, health evaluations or assessments are carried out for individuals assigned to occupations that have 
an inherent element of risk to their health or safety; where actions by employees could result in a threat to their 
health and safety or to that of another; before postings to isolated, remote or foreign locations; and where a Public 
Service policy, directive, standard, or guideline provides that such evaluations may be requested.</p><p>2.3 Because occupational health evaluations/assessments are related to the work only, they are not intended to replace 
the medical examinations carried out by personal or family physicians. Medical information can be forwarded to the 
treating physician with the individual's written request as candidates and employees remain under the care of their 
treating physician at all times.</p><p>2.4 When a health condition exists, the diagnosis, adequacy of treatment, medical control, and the state of any 
resulting or residual impairment or limitation are all factors that will be considered in making an assessment determination 
usually in consultation with the treating physician.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Application and Exclusion"><p>3.1.1 This standard applies to:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>departments and agencies that are listed under Schedule  I and Schedule IV of the <em>Financial  Administration Act</em>;</li><li>visiting scientists and students as well as persons hired on a term or casual basis who are exposed to the same 
	  hazards when working for departments and includes those on assignment with another employer;</li><li>dependants of rotational employees covered under the Foreign Service Directives.</li></ol><p>3.1.2 This standard does not apply to:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>portions of the Public Service that are subject to other authorities including the Canadian Armed Forces and 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</li><li>occupations referred to in Orders-in-Council governing physical standards for civil aviation personnel.</li><li>Contract workers.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Definitions"><p>4.1 The term "occupational health evaluation" in this standard, means any specific screening, assessment or examination 
of an individual which is carried out by an occupational health professional to determine or monitor the individual's 
occupational health status and includes, when appropriate, preventative measures such as recommended immunizations 
as well as consultations with other health professionals.</p><p>4.2 The term "occupational health professional" in this standard applies to qualified physicians, nurses or mental 
health specialists hired or delegated by the occupational health service provider, Health Canada (HC).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Authorities"><p>5.1. Establishment of Health Standards</p><p>The physical examination standards are established in consultation with the designated occupational health service 
provider and appropriate specialists by the employing department (with input from its occupational Health and Safety 
Policy Committee) and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat</p><p>5.2. Designated Occupational Health Service Provider</p><p>By delegation of  the Treasury Board, Health Canada is responsible for determining and carrying  out the occupational health evaluations of Public Service employees as the  occupational health service provider. Departments shall contact the appropriate  regional office of the Public Service Occupational Health Program (PSOHP) of <abbr title="Health Canada">HC</abbr>.</p><div><div><p>5.3. Departmental Responsibility</p><p>Departments and agencies are responsible for the application of this Standard by ensuring that evaluations are conducted 
where applicable, as indicated in section 2 of this Standard.</p><p>5.3.1 Health Evaluations for Occupational Groups</p><p>Departments shall ensure that the occupational groups listed in the first column in Appendix A undergo health evaluations 
according to the accompanying schedule in the second, third and fourth columns. When an individual is exposed to the 
hazards of more than one occupational group, the requirements of those occupational groups also apply.</p><p>5.3.2. Practical Test</p><p>When an individual is unable to meet the occupational health requirements of the position and continues not to meet 
the requirements upon further medical testing and/or by accommodation, the employing department will undertake to conduct 
a practical test, if it does not impose an undue hardship on the department, to determine whether the individual can 
safely and efficiently perform the critical tasks associated with the relevant position under actual or simulated conditions. 
The employing department, in consultation with Health Canada, appropriate specialists and the departmental Employment 
Equity unit, establishes the practical test. See Procedures, sections 9.7 and 9.8 regarding testing and accommodation.</p><p>5.3.3. Physical Abilities Test (PAT) of certain departments</p><p>Where the employing department establishes a physical abilities test (PAT) to determine the individual's physical 
fitness to carry out certain physical functions of the job (e.g. climb ladder, carry hose, wear respiratory equipment, 
etc.), it is done in consultation with appropriate specialists and includes the departmental Employment Equity unit. 
This test is usually preceded by an occupational health evaluation by Health Canada to rule out predisposing factors 
that may preclude a <abbr title="Physical Abilities Test ">PAT</abbr>. See Procedures, sections 9.7 and 9.8 regarding testing and accommodation.</p><p>5.3.4 Fitness to Work Evaluations</p><p>Fitness to work evaluations are non-scheduled evaluations to determine if an employee has been affected by a workplace 
hazard and/or is medically fit to safely and efficiently perform the tasks of a specific job. See Types of Evaluations 
in section 7.1.3.</p></div></div></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Health Evaluation Categories"><p>6.1. There are three categories of health evaluations:</p><p>6.1.1. Category 1: A confidential personal health declaration completed by the employee and reviewed by an appropriate 
occupational health professional, who will determine whether follow-up action is necessary (i.e., Category 2 or Category 
3 evaluation).</p><p>6.1.2. Category 2: A confidential health questionnaire completed by the employee together with an occupational health 
nurse and followed by a full clinical history by the nurse. The occupational health nurse or other appropriate licensed 
health care professional provides prophylactic immunizations and tests depending on the type of work and particular 
hazards. If warranted, the employee is referred for a Category 3 exam.</p><p>6.1.3. Category 3: A confidential health questionnaire completed by the employee together
with a physician and followed by a full clinical history and physical examination by the physician. The occupational 
health nurse or other appropriate licensed health care professional usually provides prophylactic immunizations and 
tests.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Types of Evaluations"><p>7.1 An occupational health evaluation is focused on the job, its hazards and related illnesses and tests, and it 
is carried out by occupational health professionals. This kind of evaluation is not the same as, and is not intended 
to, replace a general physical examination provided by the personal physician. Health Canada's occupational health 
professionals are also knowledgeable about the employer's workplace health hazards, related occupational health and 
safety legislation, human rights legislation and the policies of government. The occupational health professionals 
carry out the following types of evaluations:</p><p>7.1.1 Pre-placement (Pre-appointment)</p><p>A pre-placement health evaluation is carried out when a candidate is to be hired for a specific job that has certain 
health requirements or an inherent element of risk to health and safety. Candidates are required to meet certain occupational 
requirements of the position before being appointed to the position. See Procedures, section 9 below regarding employer 
responsibility. Most pre-placement evaluations are Category 3 evaluations. For some groups, such as returning seasonal 
workers, summer and co-op students, pre-placement evaluations are Category 1 or 2.</p><p>7.1.2 Periodic Health Evaluations</p><p>Periodic health evaluations are carried out on a periodic schedule from annually to every five years, depending 
on hazard exposure and the age of the employee, to determine if employees continue to meet the criteria, are being 
negatively affected by their work, and if they can continue working under the same work conditions without detriment 
to their health and safety or to those of others. Periodic health evaluations come under one of the three preceding 
categories.</p><p>7.1.3. Fitness to Work Evaluations (non-routine)</p><p>Fitness to work evaluations are provided to determine if an employee has been affected by a workplace hazard and/or 
is medically fit to safely and efficiently perform the tasks of a specific job. The evaluations are carried out with 
the employee's consent and with input from the treating physician, if any. The evaluations are directed towards confirming 
the employee's health capability to carry out, or continue to carry out the duties of the position and, where warranted, 
what limitations should be considered.</p><p>7.1.3.1. Departments should arrange for fitness to work evaluations where an employee:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>has been exposed to an unexpected occupational health hazard, such as a chemical spill; or</li><li>as a result of job changes, will be exposed to a different hazard or more strenuous work as indicated in the 
annex;</li><li>appears to be having difficulty in performing the duties of the position or the employee's actions appear 
to be affected by health related factors.</li><li>is absent for a lengthy period and a return date has not been established or an employee is returning to work 
after a period of medical leave and there is concern about his/her fitness for duty.</li></ol><p>NOTE: In rehabilitation/return to work cases where an action plan has already been developed and approved by the attending/assessing 
physician and the insurance company's rehabilitation staff, it is not mandatory for departments to request fitness-to-work 
evaluations from Health Canada. Only in those instances where there is concern about an employees' fitness to carry 
out their modified duties through the return to work plan or through a job change should referrals be made to Health 
Canada.</p><p>7.1.3.2. With respect to accommodation, departments will work with the individual employees to find the means of 
accommodating the employee at work. Additional input may be required from the employee's treating physician. In addition, 
there may be occasions where it would be reasonable for the manager to seek additional advice or guidance from Health 
Canada, which may include a Fitness to Work evaluation.</p><p>7.1.3.3. In accordance with departmental procedures, managers must advise the employee of the reason for the evaluation. 
It is preferable to obtain the employee's cooperation prior to the fitness to work evaluation. A letter of explanation 
containing factual, objective and pertinent information related to the purpose of the referral to Health Canada as 
well as a completed " Job Analysis" form is forwarded to the occupational health physician. Health Canada will determine 
if other records or information are required throughout the process. In all correspondence, managers should avoid using 
information that is not recorded and they should avoid collecting, using or disclosing personal information about third 
parties. To ensure transparency of the process, the information provided to Health Canada shall be shared with the 
employee, including the reasons for the disclosure to Health Canada. If the employee does not consent to undergo a 
Fitness to Work evaluation, the Labour Relations Advisor is consulted.</p><p>7.1.3.4. The fitness to work evaluation is carried out by occupational health physicians, with input from the departmental 
manager and, where appropriate, the employee's personal physician or specialist with the employee's written consent.</p><p>7.1.3.5. Following completion of the evaluation, both the employer and the employee are provided with a written 
report concerning the employee's health capacity to carry out the duties of the position and outlining specific limitations 
or physical restrictions to the employing department.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="8. Medical confidentiality"><p>8.1. The assessing health professional discloses to the employer only information that enables the employer to take 
appropriate measures, e.g. information on limitations related to the health requirements of the position. Confidential 
medical information is not provided unless it is required to determine appropriate accommodation strategies or options 
and is provided with the written consent of the individual. (See sections 9.5 and 9.6)</p><p>8.2. To ensure confidentiality of medical information, the disclosure of information during a workers compensation 
claim must be consistent with the Treasury Board Policies on Injury on Duty and Workers Compensation or according to 
the legislation and procedures of the workers compensation boards.</p><p>8.3. All medical  information, forms and records transmitted or used in connection with these  health evaluations will be maintained in a medical confidential status, and  retained by Health Canada's Public Service Occupational Health Program (PSOHP)  or within the medical community as determined by the <abbr title="Public Service  Occupational Health Program">PSOHP</abbr>, for a total period  of 30 years, 10 years active after last file activity and 20 years dormant at Library  and Archives Canada. Copies of medical records may be forwarded to the  employee's physician with the written request of the employee.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="9" title="9. Procedures"><p>9.1 All health  evaluations are to be arranged by employing departments and agencies through  the regional office of the designated occupational health provider, Health  Canada's Public Service Occupational Health Program (PSOHP), using the  prescribed form and procedures.</p><p>9.2 Departments shall inform employees and candidates about the purpose and process of the evaluation and provide 
  an interpretation of medical confidentiality (section 8) at the same time.</p><p>9.3 An individual may see a private physician; the department shall provide the approved <abbr title="Health Canada">HC</abbr> medical form and a description 
of the work, including the hazards, the extent of exposure and the use of protective equipment. The private physician 
enters the results on the form provided and, with the written consent of the employee, forwards the form along with 
the laboratory test results in confidence to the Health Canada health professional, who will determine if the form 
is complete and necessary tests carried out. The individual's written consent should also include an agreement for 
the assessing health professional to communicate with the employee's examining physician. Subsequently, an assessment 
is forwarded by Health Canada's occupational health professional to the employing department and the individual. With 
the possible exception of workers compensation claims (see sections 8.2 and 7.1.3.1 iv), all requests for evaluations 
from outside consultants must follow this procedure.</p><p>9.4. Routine occupational health evaluations will be initiated in accordance with the frequencies specified in Appendix 
A. However, in individual cases, <abbr title="Health Canada">HC</abbr> may recommend investigations or evaluations at intervals that are more or less 
frequent than those prescribed in Appendix A. Health evaluations shall be carried out wherever practicable during normal 
working hours.</p><p>9.5. Following all health evaluations, Health Canada occupational health professional will forward to the department 
an assessment report indicating whether the individual meets the health requirements of the job as well as to the individual 
if the requirements are not met or limitations are indicated. This report shall not contain any medical, psychological 
or psychiatric diagnosis. (See section 8.1)</p><p>9.6. Where work limitations are identified, the report will incorporate information to management concerning the 
individual's ability to perform the task (functional capacity). The <abbr title="Public Service Occupational Health Program">PSOHP</abbr> health professional can arrange discussions 
with management.</p><p>9.7. Where an individual is unable to meet the health requirements of the position outlined in this standard along 
with the specifications in <abbr title="Health Canada">HC</abbr>'s Occupational Health Assessment Guide and continues not to meet these requirements upon 
further medical testing, if done, the employing department will make every effort, up to the point of undue hardship, 
to accommodate the individual. Any additional medical testing and/or accommodation measures are planned in consultation 
with the <abbr title="Health Canada">HC</abbr> occupational health professional. The department may proceed with accommodation at any stage of the occupational 
health evaluation process and in accordance with the Treasury Board Policy on the Duty to Accommodate Persons with 
Disabilities in the Federal Public Service.</p><p>9.8. If an individual does not meet the health requirements of the position after further testing, and/or accommodation, 
the employing department will undertake to conduct a practical test, if it does not impose undue hardship on the department 
(see Practical Test under Departmental Responsibility in section 5.3.2). Practical testing may also assist the employing 
department to evaluate the need and scope of accommodation.</p><p>9.9. When a health problem is discovered, the individual is referred to his or her personal physician and copies 
of medical records may be forwarded to the individual's physician with the written consent of the individual.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="10" title="10. Official Languages"><p>Services offered to departments and employees by Health Canada should conform to the Official Languages Act and 
Treasury Board policy on the issue.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="11" title="11. Costs"><p>11.1. Health Canada receives appropriations to provide health evaluation services to departments and employees.</p><p>11.2. Employing departments are responsible for the following costs:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>some additional specialist services and specialized tests, if they are not covered by Health Canada. Wherever 
possible, departments should be made aware of additional costs beforehand.</li><li>travel for a health evaluation. The employee shall be considered in travel status and
reimbursement of expenses incurred shall be governed by the National Joint Council Travel
Directive or other applicable authority.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="12" title="12. Monitoring"><p>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat will monitor the effectiveness of this standard by:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>reviewing the overall departmental application of the Occupational Health Evaluation Standard, the Occupational 
Safety and Health Policy and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Policy;</li><li>examining complaints from employees, departments, <abbr title="Public Service Occupational Health Program">PSOHP</abbr>, the Canadian Human Rights Commission and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada<a href="#fn1" name="fnr1" title="See footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a></li><li>reviewing audit and evaluation reports, both internal and external, on the application of this standard.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="13" title="13.
