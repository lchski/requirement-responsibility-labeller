Effective date"><p>March 17, 2003</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Preamble"><p>
        On December 24, 2001, amendments to the <em>Official Secrets Act,</em> as adopted by Parliament became law. The
        Act was renamed the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/o-5/text.html"><em>Security of Information Act</em> (SOIA)
        </a>.
        The revised Act, among other things, modernizes the espionage provisions and introduces new concepts, such as
        <strong>"special operational information"</strong> and <strong>"persons permanently bound to secrecy."</strong></p><p>
        In general terms, "special operational information," which is defined in section 8 of the Act, describes
        the most operationally sensitive government information, which the government is taking measures to safeguard. The
        unauthorized disclosure of such information would cause obvious damage to the Government of Canada.
      </p><p>The following are examples of this type of information:</p><ul><li>Past and current confidential sources of information, intelligence, or assistance to the Government of Canada.</li><li>
          Places, persons, groups, or entities who were, are, or are intended to be targets of covert collection efforts
          by government.
        </li><li>The identity of any person engaged in such covert collection activities.</li><li>Military operational plans for armed conflicts.</li><li>The means used by government to protect information, including encryption and any vulnerabilities.</li><li>Similar information to the above that relates to or is received from foreign entities or terrorist groups.</li></ul><p>
        Another new concept is that of "persons permanently bound to secrecy." These are persons held to a higher level
        of accountability for certain unauthorized disclosures. While all persons may be subject to the provisions of section 4
        of the <em>Security of Information Act</em> (dealing with unauthorized disclosure generally), there are now specific
        provisions dealing with the unauthorized disclosure of "special operational information" by "persons permanently bound
        to secrecy."
      </p><p>Unauthorized disclosure of this type of information by these persons will be subject to sanction</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>whether the information is true or not;</li><li>
          whenever the information was obtained by the persons, e.g. before being designated or after having left the
          position that triggered the persons to be "permanently bound to secrecy"; and
        </li><li>however the persons obtained the information.</li></ol><p>
        The above applies to such persons even after they have changed positions, left government service, or finished a
        contract.
      </p><p>Persons may become part of this special regime in two ways:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li><strong>Automatically</strong>: as current or former members or employees (including former members or employees
          as of December 24, 2001) of particular departments set out in the schedule to the Act (such as the Canadian Security
          Intelligence Service, the Communications Security Establishment, and certain branches of the Royal Canadian Mounted
          Police); or
        </li><li><strong>Selectively</strong>: if a deputy head is of the opinion that, by reason of a person's office, position,
          duties, contract or arrangement, the person had, has, or will have authorized access to "special operational information"
          <strong><span class="underLine">and</span></strong> it is in the interest of national security to permanently bind
          that person to secrecy, this person may be notified that he or she has been so designated. Designation should not
          be the norm. It should generally only apply to those with an <strong>intimate knowledge</strong> of "special operational
          information."
        </li></ol><p>
        A person need only be "permanently bound to secrecy" once during their lifetime, either through employment in a
        scheduled department or by designation.
      </p><p><strong>The purpose of this operational standard is to provide administrative procedures for</strong></p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>
          departments that are listed in the schedule to the Act, (referred to as scheduled departments, see section
          3 of this Standard); and
        </li><li>
          the designation by notice of employees in non-scheduled departments and of persons and government contractors
          in scheduled and non-scheduled departments. (See section 4 of this Standard.)
        </li></ol><p><strong>
          Departments shall consult with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat if there is a requirement to amend
          the schedule.
        </strong></p><p>
        This standard addresses also selection criteria to help identify persons who may be designated by notice. In addition,
        the standard emphasizes the importance that security awareness and briefings act as a preventative measure to encourage
        persons to safeguard "special operational information."
      </p><p>
        The SOIA creates specific offences for "persons permanently bound to secrecy." However, all employees, members and
        government contractors have responsibilities to safeguard sensitive information under the
        <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12322"><em>Government Security Policy</em></a>.
      </p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Scheduled Departments"><section anchor="3.1" title="A. Current or former members or employees"><p>
          All current or former members or employees of <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/o-5/text.html">scheduled departments</a>
          are "permanently bound to secrecy" by virtue of their employment<em>.</em> Scheduled departments should include in
          the letter of offer of employment a statement that the individual will be "permanently bound to secrecy" or otherwise
          ensure that incoming members and employees are advised. Scheduled departments are to maintain documentary proof of
          the employment status of current or former members or employees.
        </p><p>
          The form entitled "Record of a Person in a Scheduled Department or Agency Under the <em>
            Security of Information
            Act
          </em> (SOIA)" (TBS/SCT 330-316, see appendix A), shall be completed for
          each person.
        </p><p>The scheduled departments are listed below:</p><ul><li>Canadian Security Intelligence Service</li><li>Communications Security Establishment</li><li>National Research Council Canada - Communications Branch</li><li>Office of the Communications Security Establishment Commissioner</li><li>Office of the Inspector General of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service</li><li>Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Criminal Intelligence Program</li><li>Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Protective Operations Program</li><li>Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Security Service</li><li>Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Technical Operations Program</li><li>Security Intelligence Review Committee</li></ul><p>
          Departments should submit written recommendations to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat in order to request
          amendments be made to the Schedule to the <em>Act</em>.
        </p></section><section anchor="3.2" title="B. Recording procedures"><h4>(1) Current and former members or employees</h4><p>Scheduled departments should proceed by forwarding the data to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, as follows:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>new entrants - at the time the person commences employment in a scheduled department or area;</li><li>
            current members or employees - at the time of the updating of the person's security clearance, if the person
            has not already been entered into the Canadian Security Intelligence Service central registry; or
          </li><li>
            departing members or employees - as part of the departmental security exit process, if the person has not already
            been entered into the Canadian Security Intelligence Service central registry.
          </li></ol><p>
          Scheduled departments shall, for each person, forward the data on the form entitled "
            Record
            of a Person in a Scheduled Department or Agency Under the <em>Security of Information Act</em> (SOIA)" (TBS/SCT 330-316)
          
          to the central registry of the Administrative Information Holdings, IHD, of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service
          (CSIS). The originally signed copy of this form shall also be forwarded to CSIS.
        </p><p>
          Scheduled departments should place a copy of form TBS/SCT 330-316 on
          the person's security screening file.
        </p><p>
          Scheduled departments need neither collect nor forward data to the central registry at the Canadian Security Intelligence
          Service on former members or employees.
        </p><h4>(2) Other persons working in scheduled departments</h4><p>
          Non-members and non-employees working in scheduled departments are <strong>not</strong> automatically "persons permanently
          bound to secrecy." If such persons need to be "permanently bound to secrecy," then the process identified in section
          4 applies.
        </p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Designation by Notice of Selected Individuals"><p>
        Subsection 10(1) of the Act provides that persons, who
        are <strong>neither</strong> members <strong>nor</strong> employees of scheduled departments, may be designated, by
        notice in writing, to the effect that they are "permanently bound to secrecy" because, by reason of their office, position,
        duties, contract or arrangement, the persons had, have, or will have authorized access to "special operational information"
        <strong><span class="underLine">and</span></strong> it is in the interest of national security to permanently bind
        those persons to secrecy.
      </p><p>
        By way of guidance, designation <strong>will not normally be required</strong> for the vast majority of persons,
      </p><ul><li>
          who may be provided with some "special operational information" as part of the intelligence they receive from
          departments; <span class="underLine">and/or</span></li><li>
          who are aware of particular aspects of such information; <span class="underLine">and/or</span></li><li>
          who may <strong>from time to time</strong> give support and assistance to scheduled departments.
        </li></ul><p>
        However, those persons who have <strong>intimate knowledge</strong> of "special operational information" should
        be designated. To assist the Departmental Security Officers in determining whether a person has intimate knowledge
        of "special operational information" and whether to recommend to the deputy head that a person should be designated,
        criteria and examples are provided. Circumstances may exist where the person would not necessarily hold a security
        clearance and nevertheless have intimate knowledge.
      </p><p>
        Even where the deputy head <strong>is not</strong> of the opinion that a person had, has, or will have intimate
        knowledge of "special operational information" to the extent expressed in the criteria and examples, the deputy head
        may consider it appropriate to designate the person in the interest of national security because of the particulars
        of the "special operational information" that the person had, has, or will have access to.
      </p><h3>(a) Government contractors</h3><p>
        The deputy head of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) may designate contractors as "persons permanently
        bound to secrecy", when PWGSC is the contracting authority. Contractors operating under PWGSC contracts may be designated
        by another deputy head, where that deputy head has been authorized for this purpose by the Minister of Public Works
        and Government Services.
      </p><p>
        Contractors for whom PWGSC is <strong>not</strong> the contracting authority may be designated as "persons permanently
        bound to secrecy" by the deputy head of the department that awards the contract.
      </p><h3>(b) Secondments, attachments, and working agreements with the Government of Canada</h3><p>
        Persons seconded, attached, or under a working agreement with a department may be designated by the deputy head
        of the <strong>host</strong> department, unless they are already "persons permanently bound to secrecy." Departments
        should ensure that secondment, attachment, or working agreement documentation indicates that the person may need to
        be "permanently bound to secrecy."
      </p><p>
        After the designation process has been completed, the host department shall provide the person's <strong>home</strong>
        department with copies of the "Recommendation to Designate" form, the "Notice of Designation" form, the "Notice of
        Designation" letter and, if it has been used in the process, the "Affidavit of Service" form. This documentation should
        also be retained within the home department's personnel security screening file.
      </p><h3>(c) Exceptional Cases</h3><p>
        The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/o-5/text.html">
          Act at section 8(2)(<em>e</em>)
        </a> deals with those exceptional
        cases where it may be difficult to identify a relevant deputy head. It is recommended, therefore, that the Departmental
        Security Officer contact their departmental Legal Services when presented with such cases.
      </p><section anchor="4.1" title="A) Criteria"><p>
          The Departmental Security Officer should consider the following in determining whether to recommend that a person
          be a "person permanently bound to secrecy".
        </p><p>
          The criteria and examples are <strong>only</strong> guidelines and are not exclusive.
        </p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li><ul><li>Did, does or will the person's duties require close and regular access to "special operational information"?</li><li>
                Did, does or will the person's formal duties involve the provision of regular assistance to activities involving
                "special operational information"?
              </li><li>
                Did, does or will the person's workplace or official working arrangement necessarily imply the acquisition
                of intimate knowledge of "special operational information"?
              </li><li>
                Was, is or will the person be in a situation where intimate knowledge of "special operational information"
                is provided over time?
              </li><li>
                Is the information previously obtained by an individual in the course of his or her duties still viewed to
                be of a highly sensitive nature, requiring that he or she be notified.
              </li></ul><p><strong>and</strong></p></li><li><ul><li>Are there factors in the interest of national security that will make it necessary to designate the person?</li><li>
                In addition to the Manager's recommendation, the Departmental Security Officer may conduct a review of the
                person's security screening file, as part of his or her analysis.
              </li></ul></li></ol></section><section anchor="4.2" title="B) Examples of persons who may need to be designated, if they meet the above listed criteria"><ul><li>
            Persons in departments and certain government contractors, who <strong>work with</strong> "special operational
            information" on a <strong>regular</strong> basis. (e.g. analyze, write reports, review, and/or make recommendations).
            Such persons may include ministerial staff and policy and program analysts.
          </li><li>
            Departments may include in arrangements and agreements with organizations outside of the Government of Canada
            (e.g. police forces, provincial and municipal governments, and private sector organizations) that their employees
            may be designated as "persons permanently bound to secrecy" as a result of their activities involving "special
            operational information."
          </li><li>
            Government contractors and others who <strong>provide specific project support</strong> to activities that
            involve "special operational information." Such persons would
            <ol><li>
                work <strong>within</strong> a department listed in the schedule and other departments where they would
                be working <strong>"along side"</strong> members or employees, such that they would acquire <strong>
                  intimate

                  over
                  time
                </strong>, these persons would gain <strong>intimate knowledge</strong> of "special operational information."
              </li></ol></li><li>
            Foreign exchange officials who are working on a regular basis with "special operational information" as part
            of their official duties may be designated.
          </li><li>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat may issue technical documentation to provide additional guidance.</li></ul></section><section anchor="4.3" title="C) Persons who cannot be designated by notice"><div class="indent1"><p>

          Questions related to the designation of other Governor-in-Council appointees (e.g. deputy ministers, associate deputy
          ministers, heads of agencies or crown corporations) should be directed to the Director of Security Operations, Privy
          Council Office.
        </p></section><section anchor="4.4" title="D) Procedures for designation by notice"><ul><li>
            Departmental Security Officers should consider the above, including the criteria and examples, before recommending
            to the deputy head that a person should be designated. <strong>
              Special care must be taken to ensure that the designation
              is warranted because of the permanent nature of the designation.
            </strong></li><li>
            Departments may include in agreements or arrangements with organizations outside of the Government of Canada
            (e.g. police forces, provincial departments, municipalities, and private sector organizations) that their employees
            may be designated as "persons permanently bound to secrecy," as a result of their activities involving "special
            operational information."
          </li><li>
            Before a designation by notice of a foreign exchange official working in Canada may take place, the home government
            department of the foreign exchange official shall be advised in writing. Such arrangements should form part of
            any future working agreement between the two country's government departments.
          </li><li>
            Managers should use the above as a guide in their criteria for selection of a person to be "permanently bound
            to secrecy." Under exceptional circumstances (e.g. the manager has been posted overseas), the Departmental Security
            Officer shall complete the manager's portion of the form.
          </li><li>
            Departmental Security Officers shall review the selection made by the manager, and if the DSO concurs that
            the designation is warranted, they are to recommend to the deputy head that the person be "permanently bound to
            secrecy".
          </li><li>
            The deputy head shall consider <strong>individually</strong> each form entitled

            As soon as possible after the deputy head has signed form TBS/SCT 330-317B
            and thereby designated a person, the Departmental Security Official shall ensure that the person is briefed in

          Departmental Security Officers are encouraged to consult with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for guidance
          and assistance. <a href="#cha10">(See section 10)</a></p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Security Screening Requirements"><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>
          "Persons permanently bound to secrecy" do not obtain a higher security clearance level by reason of their designation,
          nor do they gain unlimited, special access to safeguarded information. <strong>The need-to-know principle remains.</strong></li><li>
          While it is preferable that a person has a security clearance, it is not a requirement for a person to be "permanently
          bound to secrecy."
        </li><li>
          The Departmental Security Officer may review the security screening file of a person who is to be "permanently
          bound to secrecy."<br />
           <br /><em>
            The Canadian Security Intelligence Service shall, on behalf of the Government of Canada, record and store
            in the central registry of the Security Screening Branch, the information and documentation that it receives on
            all persons who are "persons permanently bound to secrecy."
          </em><br />
           
        </li><li>
          When a person is "permanently bound to secrecy" under the Act, <strong>it is a good security practice</strong>,
          as it is the case of all persons holding a security clearance, to conduct update and exit interviews as part of
          the security screening cycle. The following apply therefore to both of those groups of persons.
        </li><li>
          Departmental Security Officers in scheduled and non-scheduled departments should ensure that subject interviews
          are conducted with all persons that have undergone a renewal of their security screening at the Level III (TOP
          SECRET) in accordance with section 10.5(b) of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12322"><em>
              Government Security
              Policy
            </em></a>. As it is also the case for TOP SECRET renewals, where CONFIDENTIAL or SECRET level security screenings
          have been renewed, the "<a href="/tbsf-fsct/330-47-eng.asp">
            Security Screening Certificate and Briefing Form,"
            TBS/SCT 330-47
          </a>, shall be completed as confirmation that the person has been reminded of their security obligations.
        </li><li>
          Departmental Security Officers, in the case of government contractors working on contracts issued by their
          department, are to ensure that subject interviews and the <a href="/tbsf-fsct/330-47-eng.asp">
            "Security Screening
            Certificate and Briefing Form," TBS/SCT 330-47
          </a>, are or have been completed.
        </li><li><strong>
            When a person "permanently bound to secrecy" stops working with a department, he or she is required
            to undergo an exit interview conducted by a security official or an appropriate security exit procedure, both of
            which shall include a formal sign off of the form
          </strong><a href="/tbsf-fsct/330-47-eng.asp" title="Security Screening Certificate and Briefing Form"><strong>
              TBS/SCT
              330-47
            </strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>Individuals shall be reminded of their ongoing obligations under the Act and the consequences of any violations.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Security Awareness Program"><p>
        The Security Awareness Program is an ideal method through which the security responsibilities of persons, including
        those who have been "permanently bound to secrecy", should be reinforced. Scheduled departments and departments with
        designated employees must conduct a security awareness program as required under section 10.5 of the
        <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12322"><em>Government Security Policy</em></a>. Security awareness messages may be disseminated
        by means of briefing sessions, videos, reading material, posters, and pop-up images on the computer screens.
      </p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Sanctions"><p>
        Breaches of security that fall within the offence provisions of the Act are extremely serious. Departmental Security
        Officers shall ensure that the deputy head is advised of such incidents as soon as possible. Security access privileges
        to classified information and/or to secure premises may be suspended by the appropriate official until administrative,
        disciplinary and/or criminal processes have come to an end. The end result of these investigations or prosecutions
        may be taken into consideration by the appropriate official in determining whether to restore, or limit, the security
        access privileges or whether to revoke or alter the security clearance.
      </p><p>
        Departmental Security Officers may refer to section 10.15 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12322"><em>
            Government
            Security Policy
          </em></a> for examples of the reporting procedures. It should be noted that prosecutions involving "special
        operational information" shall not commence without the consent of the Attorney General of Canada.
      </p><p>
        Departments are to conduct damage assessments for breaches of security regarding "special operational information."
        They are to make recommendations based on the lessons learned from their investigation of those breaches. Such recommendations
        are to be shared with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, so in turn the benefits may be shared with other departments,
        as per section 10.15 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12322"><em>Government Security Policy</em></a>.
      </p></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="8. Review"><p>
