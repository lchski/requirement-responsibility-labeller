<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><doc title="Policy on Employee Assistance Program" documentID="12542" versionID="1" language="en" space="preserve" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="PolicySchema.xsd"><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="Policy objective"><p>To foster and maintain the well-being and productivity of employees by providing confidential assistance or short-term 
counselling to those who are experiencing personal or work-related problems.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Policy statement"><p>The government recognizes that it is possible in the work environment to identify employees with problems, including 
those related to substance abuse, and to motivate them to seek assistance or treatment at an early stage. Although there 
are numerous organizations in the community to help people with various problems, assistance is often required to determine 
the most appropriate resource. To this end, the government makes available to employees a confidential and voluntary Employee 
Assistance Program (EAP) without prejudice to job security or career progression.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Application"><p>This policy applies to the departments and agencies listed under Part I of Schedule I of the <em>Public Service Staff 
Relations Act</em>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Policy requirements"><p>Departments must ensure that:</p><ul><li>an EAP coordinator is appointed;</li><li>employees are provided with EAP services that conform to this policy, including definitions in Appendix A;</li><li>the confidentiality and privacy of EAP information is maintained in accordance with Appendix B;</li><li>EAP practitioners abide by the Code of Ethics in Appendix C;</li><li>EAP services are accessible to disabled employees;</li><li>EAP services are available in both official languages;</li><li>employees are kept informed about the program and how to access its services;</li><li>managers and supervisors are provided with education on matters related to the program and informed of their responsibility 
to refer employees with work performance problems related to personal difficulties to their departmental EAP;</li><li>where employees are likely to be involved in critical incidents because of the nature of their work, a procedure is 
established to provide an initial stress debriefing session as soon as possible after such an incident and EAP follow-up 
if required;</li><li>leave credits for treatment and rehabilitation are used in accordance with existing collective agreements and Public 
Service policies;</li><li>employee representatives are consulted and are provided with the opportunity to develop jointly and to participate 
fully in the application of the departmental EAP, including its referral, educational and promotional aspects.</li><li>the quality and accountability of the EAP is periodically assessed.</li></ul><section anchor="4.1" title="Services to families"><p>Departments must ensure that reasonable access to departmental EAP services is provided to dependants of employees who 
live, have lived, or will live outside Canada under the provisions of the Foreign Service directives, or who are subject 
to the Isolated Posts Directive, or in exceptional circumstances such as a work related hostage-taking incident.</p><p>Departments have the option of expanding EAP services to the dependants of all their employees. Services may be offered 
to dependants separately or at the same time as the employee. They may also be offered generally or only when EAP practitioners 
perceive a need. Finally, departments may decide not to provide family services beyond the policy requirements in the previous 
paragraph.</p><p>Where family services are offered, these are limited to assessment and referral services with very short-term counselling 
(see definitions), in keeping with the intent of the Program. The counselling is intended primarily to assist employees 
and their dependants to recognize the need to obtain appropriate counselling services from a specialist in the community. 
It is not intended to replace community counselling services that are available for families.</p><p>If files are created, the same precautions must apply to the personal information of family members as to that of the 
employee. Other considerations include compliance with the requirements of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the <em>Access to Information 
Act</em> and the Government Security Policy.</p></section><section anchor="4.2" title="External services"><p>Where EAP services are provided by a non-governmental agency or another department, departments must ensure that the 
services conform to this policy. Moreover, departments must continue to assess the quality and accountability of the program.</p><p>When preparing EAP contracts, the departmental contracting unit or the officer responsible for service contracts should 
be consulted. Where neither exists, assistance should be sought from the specialists in professional service contracting 
at Public Works and Government Services Canada.</p><p>Contracts must specify that personal information collected for EAP purposes is deemed to be under the control of the 
department and is consequently subject to the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Responsibilities"><p>On request, Health Canada, through the Public Service Health Program, shall:</p><ul><li>provide professional and technical advice about the EAP to departments;</li><li>provide or arrange for medical diagnosis or initial counselling on alcoholism or other health problems and refer clients 
to community agencies for subsequent treatment; and</li><li>provide consultative services to departments and the Public Service Commission with respect to the health-medical aspects 
of training programs.</li></ul><p>Health Canada shall ensure the continuous professional development of its occupational health personnel, including nurses 
and physicians, on substance abuse counselling and rehabilitation techniques.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Monitoring"><p>To assess the effectiveness of this policy, the Treasury Board Secretariat requires that departments submit a report 
on program structure and a statistical summary of its EAP activities. The statistical reports should not permit the identification 
of clients. The Secretariat requests the first report for the two year period ending March 31, 1993 and subsequently every 
two years.</p><p>The Privacy Commissioner has a responsibility to ensure that the privacy rights of individuals are respected. Discretionary 
audits conducted by the Privacy Commissioner's Office provide an independent verification that the promises of confidentiality 
are being kept in regard to the collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal of personal information.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="References"><p>Treasury Board documents :</p><ul><li>Occupational Safety and Health Policy;</li><li>Security, Organization and Administration Standard;</li><li>Physical Security Standard;</li><li>Information Technology Security Standard;</li><li>Indemnification of Servants of the Crown</li><li>Provision of Services for Employees with Disabilities</li><li>Conflict of Interest and Post Employment</li><li>Harassment in the workplace</li><li>Contracting Policy</li><li>Contracting Policy Guideline</li><li>Regulations respecting government contracts(Appendix B)</li><li>Contracts Directive (Appendix C)</li></ul><p>Provision of Legal Services to Public Servants, T.B.

General"><p>1.1 In accordance with the Government Security Policy and the <em>Privacy Act</em>, departments shall have policies and 
procedures that safeguard client information in records or gathered in counselling sessions.</p><p>1.2 Individual client case files are required only where documentation is necessary for practitioners to carry out their 
EAP functions. When information is recorded, it should be kept to a minimum and it may include dates, the general nature 
of problems, minimal progress notes, recommended referrals and non-medical reports related to a client's work capability 
or limitations. Practioners should refrain from recording in an individual case file personal information relating to a 
third party. Individual case files shall be designated sensitive and marked as PROTECTED - EAP.</p><p>1.3 To enhance confidentiality, personal identifiers such as the client's name, title and address may be replaced with 
a number which is cross-referenced to a master file that contains this information separately.</p><p>1.4 At the outset of the initial interview, the practitioner shall advise the client, orally or in written format, of 
the confidentiality policy and its limitations.</p><p>If personal information is collected, the client is advised that it will be treated in accordance with the provisions 
of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. This includes advising clients of the following:</p><ul><li>the type of information that will be collected, the purpose for which the information was obtained and the length of 
time it will be kept in the individual case file before being destroyed;</li><li>the right to review information contained in the file, to request corrections or to attach notes;</li><li>the right to complain to the Privacy Commissioner about any decisions on access to personal information collected for 
EAP purposes, whether for delays, requested exemption, language of choice or any irregularity affecting the collection, 
use, disclosure, retention and disposal of this information;</li><li>the possibility that this information may be reviewed by the Privacy Commissioner.</li></ul><p>1.5 The practitioner cannot promise confidentiality in the following situations:</p><ul><li>the circumstances set out in subsection 8(2) of the <em>Privacy Act</em> which include court subpoenas;</li><li>suspected cases of child abuse; or</li><li>a threat of suicide or illegal activity.</li></ul><p>When such information is received, the practitioner is advised to consult the departmental EAP Coordinator and legal 
counsel immediately, while respecting the confidentiality of the individual's identity.</p><p>1.6 Employee Assistance Program case files are a personal information bank that must conform with <em>Privacy Act</em> 
requirements on the collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal of personal information and must be described in 
Info Source (Sources of Federal Employee Information).</p><p>1.7 Personal information collected by an agency providing EAP services under contract to a department is deemed to be 
personal information under the control of that department and is therefore subject to the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p><p>1.8 When assessing or auditing their EAP, departments must protect the confidentiality of personal information.</p></section><section anchor="B.2" title="2. Physical security"><p>2.1 The government Security policy and standards requires that sensitive personal information receive enhanced protection. 
The files must be protected by particular storage and transmittal standards in accordance with the Treasury Board Security 
Organization and Administration Standard, Physical Security Standard and Information Technology Security Standard.</p><p>2.2 All client case files and sensitive program information require the use of approved locked storage space and containers. 
Only authorized personnel have access to EAP case files.</p><p>2.3 Departments must ensure that agencies providing EAP services under contract to departments provide a level of security 
for EAP information equivalent to that described in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 above.</p></section><section anchor="B.3" title="3. Release of information"><p>3.1 Personal information relating to individual case files of EAP clients is released only with the written consent of 
the client or where the law requires or permits the release of that information.</p><p>3.2 Written consent shall include the following:</p><ul><li>the name of the person or agency to whom the information is to be released;</li><li>the specific information to be released;</li><li>the date of consent;</li><li>the client's signature; and</li><li>the expiry date of the consent.</li></ul><p>3.3 EAP practitioners should allow clients to view, to the extent possible, the information that concerns them without 
obliging them to present an official request in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Recourse to the <em>Privacy Act</em> 
would only be required in exceptional circumstances.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Practitioners should refer to the Employee Privacy Code and their departmental procedure for guidance on employee access 
to the data banks listed in Info Source.</p></section><section anchor="B.4" title="4. Role of the Privacy Commissioner"><p>4.1 In the course of an investigation of a presumed violation of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the Privacy Commissioner has 
access to relevant information in EAP files. Investigations carried out by the Privacy Commissioner as a result of complaints 
are secret and may not be discussed publicly.</p><p>4.2 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner may also conduct periodic compliance reviews of EAP case files to provide 
independent verification that privacy rights are being protected and to ensure that the information contained therein is 
collected, used, retained and disposed of in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p><p>4.3 The EAP practitioner who has custody of the files will be present during these EAP case file reviews by officers 
from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</p></section><section anchor="B.5" title="5. Disposal of records"><p>5.1 PROTECTED-EAP case files must be retained and disposed of in accordance with schedules approved by the National Archivist 
and issued in General Records Disposal Schedules of the Government of Canada, PAC 86/001. Individual case files must be 
destroyed two years after the date of the client's most recent contact with EAP. PROTECTED - EAP case files may be destroyed 
earlier, with the client's consent, or at the client's request. In situations where the client or the EAP practitioner involved 
is leaving the department, or in the event that a contract is cancelled or not-renewed, the EAP case files may only be transferred 
to the new service provider with the client's consent. In other situations, EAP case files are to be destroyed.</p><p>5.2 Employee Assistance Program case files should be disposed of in an appropriate manner, which may involve burning 
under controlled conditions, pulping, pulverizing, shredding or another destruction method using equipment appropriate to 
the level of sensitivity of the information involved. The departmental information management staff provides guidance on 
the measures to apply.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C - Code of Ethics"><section anchor="C.1" title="Introduction"><p>This Code sets out the ethical attitudes expected of Employee Assistance Program (EAP) practitioners in the Public Service 
regardless of their formal preparation, place of work or population focus.</p><p><em><strong>Respect for the dignity and rights of persons</strong></em></p><p>Fundamental to the principle of respect for the dignity of persons is the belief that all persons have a right to appreciation 
of their innate worth as human beings.</p><p>Every EAP client must be respected regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital 
status, family status, disability, conviction for which a pardon has been granted, political affiliation, social or economic 
status, or physical or mental capabilities or characteristics or other similar grounds.</p><p>Clients of EAP have a right to consent to matters that affect their treatment and that are within their control. Moreover, 
EAP is directed at decreasing the dependency of clients who seek advice and sponsoring positive personal control.</p><p>A practitioner must:</p><p>1. respect all clients regardless of their personal characteristics.</p><p>2. respect the client's right of self-determination by encouraging active involvement in decisions related to treatment 
and referral;</p><p>3. respect the client's right to privacy and confidentiality by collecting only personal information that is relevant 
and by sharing it only to the extent required for referral, with the informed consent of the client.</p><p>4. respect the client's right of informed consent by providing all the information necessary so that a reasonable person 
in similar circumstances would be able to make a reasoned and informed choice;</p><p>5. obtain, except in those instances where the law requires or permits the release of information*, signed consent forms 
from the client in all situations where the release of personal information is requested.</p><p>6. honour commitments made to the client;</p><p>7. not exploit relationships with clients to enhance the practitioner's own self-worth or position in the department, 
agency or community;</p><p>8. encourage respect for the dignity of others and avoid practices that are inconsistent with the legal, civil or human 
rights of others;</p><p>9. respect the social norms and moral attitudes of the community in which the practitioner works; and</p><p>10. respect the right of the client to discontinue participation in the program at any time.</p><p>* The Canadian social system provides for the protection of legal, civil and human rights. However, the needs and rights 
of others in the same social context mitigate the recognition and expression of these rights.</p></section><section anchor="C.2" title="Conflict of interest"><p>Practitioners must conform to the government's Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment policy.</p><p>A practitioner must:</p><p>1. remain within the scope of the program;</p><p>2. resist exploiting of the professional relationship with the client to further any social, political, economic, personal 
or business interest;</p><p>3. refer a client to another resource when the practitioner, for a personal reason, cannot provide service to the client;</p><p>4. inform concerned parties of possible or actual conflicts of interest;</p><p>5. initiate steps that precipitate a reasonable solution without causing undue harm to the client or the organization; 
and</p><p>6. remain neutral in conflicts between the client, the union, or management.</p></section><section anchor="C.3" title="Competency"><p>A responsible counsellor recognizes the need to make continuous efforts to upgrade and refine skills. Practitioners should 
acknowledge their limitations and provide services that are consistent with their skills.</p><p>A practitioner must:</p><p>1. offer services that are within his or her established competence and the program's defined parameters. When the problems 
of clients are beyond these limits, practitioners must refer clients to an appropriate resource;</p><p>2. seek consultation with fellow practitioners or other appropriate resources in managing cases when the practitioner 
encounters clients or situations that are beyond the program's parameters or the practitioner's expertise;</p><p>3. ensure that appropriate referrals are made to recognized resources;</p><p>4. continually evaluate his or her own background, experiences and values so as to assess their influence on interactions 
with others and attend, in accordance with departmental policies, educational programs directed at improving performance; 
and</p><p>5. accurately represent his or her own professional qualifications, competence and purposes of the program.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="D" title="Appendix D - Guidelines on Employee Assistance Program Services"><section anchor="D.1" title="Counselling service"><p>1. A response to a request for service should occur as soon as possible, preferably within one working day.</p><p>2. The first counselling session should occur within two weeks unless unforeseen circumstances arise.</p><p>3. Follow-up should be an integral part of the EAP service, usually by meeting with the client. Sometimes a letter or 
telephone call is appropriate.</p><p>4. The program normally offers up to three sessions for each new case.</p><p>5. Where employees are likely to be involved in critical incidents because of the nature of their work, the department 
must develop a procedure for initial counselling and follow-up. The same can apply to cases that involve threats of violence 
or suicide.</p></section><section anchor="D.2" title="Advisory service"><p>A response to a request for advisory services from managers, supervisors or unions should occur as soon as possible and, 
at the latest, within a week.</p></section><section anchor="D.3" title="Education service"><p>1. EAP training sessions for managers and supervisors should cover, at a minimum:</p><ul><li>the scope and limits of EAP, the confidentiality aspects, the <em>Privacy Act</em> provisions and the procedure for 
accessing the program;</li><li>the administrative role with respect to EAP and referrals;</li><li>the concepts and methods that allow for early detection of problems that interfere with job performance;</li><li>constructive methods to deal with employees experiencing performance problems due to personal or behavioural problems; 
and</li><li>support approaches to assist the employee.</li></ul><p>2. Every new employee should receive a brochure, information sheet or other appropriate format containing information 
that describes the scope and means of accessing the EAP services.</p><p>3. The departmental program should keep all employees informed of the service, its location and how to access it.</p></section><section anchor="D.4" title="Prevention activities"><p>Consistent with the program design and the organizational mandate, preventive programs should be held to educate employees 
about personal problems related to life style and work environment, and the possible responses. This may involve cooperation 
with the Public Service Health Services and the departmental safety and health committee or the safety and health representative.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>As indicated in the Occupational safety and health policy, the Treasury Board has delegated the administration of the 
Public Service Health Program to Health Canada.</p><p>The Committees and Representatives standard encourages safety and health committees to establish and promote programs 
to educate employees represented by the committee.</p></section></appendix></appendices></doc>
