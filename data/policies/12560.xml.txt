In the Public Service context the term includes an agency acting on behalf of the Treasury Board, a department or any person who acts in a supervisory or managerial capacity on behalf of a department.</p><p>Treasury Board Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) standards (Normes de sécurité et de santé au travail du Conseil du Trésor)</p><p>The expression is self-explanatory. However, it should be noted that most of these standards are:</p><ul><li>based on the CLC Part II regulations;</li><li>consulted upon in the National Joint Council and, therefore, have the force of collective agreements.</li></ul><p>Since Treasury Board OSH standards and regulations pursuant to Part II of the Canada Labour Code are legal requirements, in the case of differences the most stringent requirement is the operative one.</p></dd><dt><strong>The Public Service Health Program</strong><span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>(Le Programme de santé des fonctionnaires fédéraux) </em></span></dt><dd><p>This program is administered by Health Canada under delegation from the Treasury Board. The Public Service Health Program is a corporate resource and should be used by departments accordingly. Its services are essentially preventative and they should not interfere with or replace those available through private physicians and community health agencies.</p><p>The program deals with:</p><ul><li>health assessments of employees and emergency medical services;</li><li>environmental health investigations and surveys;</li><li>occupational health nursing services in departments;</li><li>advice to the Treasury Board on occupational safety and health matters, including advice on the development and monitoring of occupational and environmental standards, procedures and other directives for the prevention of occupational illness and injury; and on the provision of occupational health services within the Public Service;</li><li>advice to departments and managers on occupational safety and health training; first aid training, facilities, services and supplies; the selection and use of personal protective equipment and clothing; the adaptation and selection of work; and the rehabilitation and retraining of employees disabled by work injuries or illnesses;</li><li>health advice and education for employees, as well as on-the-job medical care with the cooperation and consent of the employee's private physician;</li><li>employee assistance services, as specified in the Public Service Employee Assistance Program Directive;</li><li>research and special studies.</li></ul></dd><dt><strong>Human Resources Development Canada - Labour Program as regulator</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>Développement des ressources humaines Canada - Programme du Travail, organisme de réglementation</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>The Public Service became subject to CLC Part II (Part IV as it was then known) on March 31, 1986, by an amendment to the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>. Prior to that, Human Resources Development Canada - Labour Program provided certain OSH services to departments as a corporate resource.</p><p>Human Resources Development Canada - Labour Program is now (as it always has been for other employers under the federal jurisdiction) the regulator for the Public Service on OSH matters. Its responsibility is to monitor and enforce the CLC Part II. With this in mind, it is instructive to read in the CLC Part II the duties assigned to employers and the penalties for contraventions.</p><p>To carry out its role, Human Resources Development Canada - Labour Program has designated safety officers and regional safety officers. Their duties include inspections, accident and refusal-to-work investigations and the stipulation of corrective measures.</p><p>It should be noted that Human Resources Development Canada - Labour Program has also appointed officials from:</p><ul><li>Transport Canada's Civil Aviation Directorate, to act as safety officers and regional safety officers in the administration of CLC Part II and the Aviation Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (for public servants employed in aircraft in operation);</li><li>Transport Canada's Marine Safety Directorate, to act as safety officers and regional safety officers in the administration of CLC Part II and the Marine Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (for public servants working on ships registered in Canada, or in the loading and unloading of ships).</li><li>Transport Canada's Rail Safety Directorate, to act as safety officers and regional safety officers in the administration of CLC Part II and the On-Board Trains Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (for public servants working on board trains while in operation).</li></ul></dd></dl></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B - Posting of documents and information"><p>Following is a list of the items that must be posted according to policy requirements:</p><ul><li>a copy of the Canada Labour Code, Part II;</li><li>any printed notices or other material prescribed by Human Resources Development Canada - Labour Program or the Treasury Board Secretariat;</li><li>a copy of a general policy statement worded this way:</li></ul><p>"A high priority in the Public Service of Canada is providing working conditions conducive to the safety and health of employees.</p><p>"This department is committed to promoting occupational safety and health and provides programs in both occupational safety and health and employee assistance. It also provides training and information in these areas to all employees.</p><p>"Please see your supervisor if you need more information."</p></appendix></appendices></doc>
