Context"><p><strong>3.1</strong> The  Government of Canada’s presence on the Web is highly complex. Each department’s  Web presence offers a wide variety of content to support informational  and transactional services for individuals and businesses. Web pages are  delivered through various devices and technologies that are constantly  evolving. The Government of Canada is committed to optimizing the user  experience with the online information and services provided through its Web  and mobile presence.</p><p><strong>3.2</strong> This standard mandates a basic structure for the design and layout of Government of Canada Web pages. This structure makes it easier to find and use information and services on  Government of Canada websites. The <em>Technical  Specifications for the Web and Mobile Presence</em> prescribes the visual  elements and identifiers that apply to this structure. This standard supports an  appropriate degree of consistency across websites and Web applications while  giving departments the flexibility to use evolving technologies and to develop information  and services for their target audiences.</p><p><strong>3.3</strong> For the purposes of this standard, Web usability is defined as the extent  to which specified users can find, understand and use information and services  online. Web usability can be measured through the effectiveness and efficiency  with which users can complete defined tasks online.</p><p><strong>3.4</strong> To help ensure that websites and Web  applications can be used effectively and efficiently, Web usability principles  and approaches, such as user-centred design, should be implemented.</p><p><strong>3.5</strong> This standard supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755"><em>Policy on Management of Information Technology</em></a> and the management of the  Government of Canada’s Web presence by providing senior departmental officials,  departmental chief information officers (CIOs) or equivalents, as well as heads  of communications or other officials who support the management of information  technology (IT), with additional requirements to ensure consistency in IT  management processes.</p><p><strong>3.6</strong> This standard is issued under the  authority of section 7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial  Administration Act</em></a> by the Secretary of the Treasury Board  pursuant to subsection 6(4) of the <em>Financial  Administration Act </em>and  section 3.5 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755"><em>Policy on Management of Information Technology</em></a>.</p><p><strong>3.7</strong> This standard is to be read in conjunction with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601"><em>Standard on Web Accessibility</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25875"><em>Standard on Web Interoperability</em></a> and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27088"><em>Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications  for Mobile Devices.</em></a></p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
