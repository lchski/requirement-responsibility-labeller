About these Guidelines"><p>1.1 These <em>Guidelines  on Contractual Arrangements</em> provide advice and interpretation to support  the current Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494&amp;section=text">Contracting  Policy</a></em> and its provisions pertaining to contractual arrangements. Its  purpose is to provide guidance to managers and functional specialists on the  defining characteristics and policy principles that support the use of  contractual arrangements for the acquisition of goods, services and construction  services. The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) has developed this  guidance in consultation with other departments and agencies.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 These guidelines apply only to contractual arrangements  as defined in the <em>Contracting Policy</em>.  “Contractual arrangement” is not a legal term but a policy term. This includes  arrangements with various public sector organizations (including other levels  of government and international partners) that involve the acquisition of  goods, services or construction services. They do not apply to arrangements  (such as service agreements) between federal departments, transfer payment  programs, and treaties or arrangements that do not include a procurement of  some kind. Further, as these are guidelines, they are not considered mandatory,  but rather impart advice and TBS interpretations in order to support  departments’ implementation of the Treasury Board <em>Contracting Policy</em>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Introduction"><p>3.1 Ministers may use a variety of instruments to carry out  the business of government with an equally diverse range of stakeholders. This  includes the private sector, non-profit organizations, other levels of  government, and international (state and non-state) actors. In many instances,  a minister’s use of a particular instrument will fall within well-delineated  legal and policy parameters, such as a contract or transfer payment, which have  clearly outlined requirements for Cabinet, Treasury Board or other approval.</p><p>However, in instances where working with other public  sector organizations will provide best value, a contract may be inappropriate.  Some type of administratively binding although not legally enforceable  agreement, such as a contractual arrangement, may be the only alternative.  These guidelines should help departments ask the right questions when setting  up contractual arrangements.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Key Characteristics"><div class="highlight"><p><strong>Key criteria to determine the right instrument:</strong></p><ul><li>What are you paying for?</li><li>Who directly benefits and who will use it?</li><li>Who are you paying?</li><li>Who is making the payment?</li><li>What is the source of funds?</li><li>Do you have the requisite authority to engage in  the activity?</li></ul></div><p>4.1 The following guidance offers some considerations when establishing contractual arrangements.</p><p>4.1.1 Where possible, and especially when using private  sector resources, the best option is to protect the Crown by using a contract,  which must follow the requirements of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-87-402/">Government  Contracts Regulations</a></em>   (GCRs) and the <em>Contracting Policy</em>.</p><p>However, there is a spectrum of other  instruments available. Determining the appropriate type of instrument to use  requires an understanding of the legal characteristics of each party, the  applicable laws, relevant policies, and the substance and nature of the  transaction. All are covered by the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/">Financial Administration  Act</a></em> (FAA), and all have different obligations in legislation and  policy. It is important to find the most effective tool to derive the best  value for the Crown and to set out clear expectations and payment provisions  for both sides.</p><p><strong>Figure 1: Key considerations for contractual arrangements</strong></p><p><img src="/pol-cont/28230-eng.jpg" class="col-md-12" alt="Key considerations for contractual arrangements" id="ldr1" longdesc="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28230&amp;section=longdeschtml&amp;ld=1" /></p><p>4.1.2 Generally speaking, the GCRs do not apply to  contractual arrangements, and therefore there are no requirements to solicit  bids. In addition, trade agreements generally do not apply to contractual  arrangements. For example, the <em><a href="http://www.ait-aci.ca/index_en.htm">Agreement on Internal Trade</a></em> does not apply to agreements between governments or “public bodies,” so those  agreements have been specifically carved out. International trade agreements do  not apply to contractual arrangements that have no legal recourse mechanism, as  they are not considered contracts.</p><p>There can be exceptions, however.  When in doubt, departments should consult their legal services unit to  determine whether the GCRs or trade agreements apply to a particular  arrangement.</p><p>4.1.3 Contractual  arrangements are subject to the entry limits outlined in Part I of <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494&amp;section=text#appC">Appendix  C, “Treasury Board Contracts Directive”</a> of the <em>Contracting Policy</em>. It is not only contracts that are subject to  such limits; contractual arrangements are as well, as stated in the preamble to  the <em>Contracts Directive</em>:</p><div class="highlight"><p><strong>Part I: Basic Contracting Limits</strong></p><p>“1. A contracting authority, as defined in  the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> and as specified in Column I in Schedules 1, 2, or 3, as well as in the text of  Schedule 5, may enter into a contract or contractual arrangement without the  approval of the Treasury Board, if the amount payable, which includes all  applicable taxes (including GST or HST), does not exceed the limit set out in  Columns II, IV and VI Schedules 1, 2, or 3 and in the text of Schedule 5.”</p></div><p>Typically, bids are not sought when creating contractual  arrangements; therefore, the arrangements are subject to the non-competitive  limits listed in the <em>Contracts Directive </em>(Appendix  C of the <em>Contracting Policy</em>). Any  contractual arrangements that exceed the limits in the <em>Contracts Directive</em> require Treasury Board approval.</p><p>4.1.4 Contractual  arrangements may be legally binding or not, depending on the substance of the  arrangement between the participating entities. Whatever the intention,  arrangements can be interpreted by a court as being legally binding if they  include some of the elements characteristically found in a legally binding  contract, beyond provisions to share costs, risks and benefits, such as:</p><ul><li>Jurisdictions  for dispute resolutions;</li><li>Ownership  of intellectual property and work products;</li><li>Limitation  of liability provisions;</li><li>Offer  and acceptance;</li><li>Intention  and capacity to create legal relations; and</li><li>Consent  of both parties.</li></ul><p>Consultations with legal services can help clarify questions about whether the arrangement may be legally binding or not.</p><p>4.1.5 Contractual arrangements can have various names. “Contractual  arrangement” is a generic term, often referred to by other names, including,  but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Memorandum of Understanding;</li><li>Memorandum of Agreement;</li><li>Comprehensive Research and Development  Agreement;</li><li>Exchange of Service Agreement;</li><li>Letter of Agreement; and</li><li>Collaborative Arrangement.</li></ul><p>Regardless of the name of an arrangement, the elements contained therein will dictate the effects or consequences that the arrangement has on the parties, for example, that a good, service or construction service is being provided to the department. The key questions are whether the department will acquire goods or services through this instrument, and who the participants are.</p><p>4.1.6 When the type of the payment is determined, it is a best practice for departments to use existing internal processes and controls governing the payment instrument (e.g., contract or contractual arrangement, contribution agreement), rather than creating separate processes, to ensure that due diligence is completed.</p><p>4.1.7 Prudence, probity and best value are important  considerations for contractual arrangements. A key principle of the <em>Contracting Policy</em> is that government  acquires goods, services and construction services in a manner that enhances  access, competition and fairness, and results in best value or, if appropriate,  an optimal balance of overall benefits to the Crown and to Canadians.</p><div class="highlight"><p><strong>According to subsection 4.1.8 of the <em>Contracting Policy</em>:</strong></p><p>“Public  servants who have been delegated authority to negotiate and conclude  contractual arrangements on behalf of the Crown must exercise this authority  with prudence and probity so that the contracting authority (the minister) is  acting and is seen to be acting within the letter and the spirit of the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em>, the  Treasury Board <em>Contracts Directive</em> and the government’s procurement policies, the <em><a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/nafta-alena/index.aspx?lang=eng">North  American Free Trade Agreement</a></em>, the World Trade Organization <em><a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gp_gpa_e.htm">Agreement on  Government Procurement</a></em>, and the <em>Agreement  on Internal Trade</em>.”</p></div><p>In the case of contractual arrangements, they should respect core contracting policy principles by seeking value for money, being conducted transparently, and being able to withstand public scrutiny.</p><div class="highlight"><p><strong>Examples of prudence and probity for contractual arrangements</strong></p><ul><li>Maintaining clear documentation of procurement  decision making, similar to what would be expected of a standard commercial  contract.</li><li>Providing justification for selecting the source  and method of supply (e.g., why a contractual arrangement rather than a  contract or transfer payment?), including a well-documented business analysis  for any sourcing strategy.</li><li>Maintaining evidence of value for money of the  selected approach as compared with other sourcing strategies.</li><li>Consulting legal, financial and procurement  expertise within your department early and often.</li><li>Ensuring that the appropriate contracting  authority is signing the arrangement, and that other government departments  have been consulted substantively and in a timely manner. Depending on the  activity involved, departments may need to consult the Privy Council Office,  Industry Canada, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, and Public Works and Government Services Canada,  to name a few.</li><li>Using existing procurement processes and  controls to manage contractual arrangements.</li></ul></div></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Other Considerations When Using Contractual Arrangements"><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 Treasury Board Approval"><p>After consulting with internal departmental legal and  procurement resources, departments should consult with TBS before entering into  a contractual arrangement whose total value (including any sub-agreements) is  valued above contract entry limits. As noted above, since bids are not normally  solicited when a contractual arrangement is used, non-competitive entry limits  apply.</p><p>Although policies related to limitation of liability or  intellectual property do not generally apply to contractual arrangements, it is  important to be mindful of their principles when signing a contractual  arrangement, seek any exceptions that may be appropriate, and document the file  accordingly.</p><p>Project and policy approvals may also be required prior  to entering into a contractual arrangement. Early consultation with project  management, legal, financial and procurement experts is a best practice.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Arrangements With International Partners"><p>Although the definition of contractual arrangements is  an agreement between contracting authorities and “entities of the Crown” (see  the definition of “contractual arrangement” in Appendix A), this has been further interpreted to include  agreements with other countries, public entities, non-governmental  organizations, or supranational organizations (e.g., the United Nations), where  appropriate. Careful analysis is needed to ensure that these arrangements are  not treaties, transfer payments or contracts. Foreign Affairs, Trade and  Development Canada and Public Works and Government Services should be consulted as required.</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="5.3 Transfers"><p>As  per Section 3, “Application,” of the Contracting Policy, transfers are not  covered by these guidelines. Such transfers include:</p><ul><li>Transfers between federal departments (as  defined in Section 2 of the FAA); and </li><li>Transfers as defined by the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525">Policy on  Transfer Payments</a></em> (grants, contributions or other transfer payments,  such as transfers to support programs run by other levels of government).</li></ul><p>There are times when the federal government cooperates  with other governments to carry out a project. Often, these arrangements are  embodied in federal-provincial agreements, normally governed by legislation or  related to the overall mandate of the federal authority. When this formal  government-to-government relationship is not applicable, a contractual  relationship between the federal contracting authority and the other government  entity may be appropriate. When buying goods, services or construction services  from other levels of government (provincial, municipal, other states, or even  supranational organizations), a contractual arrangement should be used.</p><p>When working with a public sector entity outside the  federal family, it is a best practice to involve departmental advisors in the  areas of financial management, procurement and legal services early in the  process to determine the best course of action and whether contractual arrangements  are required.</p><div class="highlight"><h4>Should it be a contractual arrangement?</h4><p>When working with other levels of government, the following indicators can help departments determine whether a contractual arrangement is required. Generally, the more indicators there are, the more likely it is that a contractual arrangement is required. Indicators may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><ul><li>The Crown receives a good, service or  construction at a value commensurate with overall costs and may include title,  possession, control or use of intangibles.</li><li>The transaction is covered by the GCRs (a  transaction at no cost is not likely covered) and meets the definition of  goods, services or a construction contract.</li><li>The arrangement involves the private sector in  the delivery of the good, service or construction.</li><li>The good, service or construction can be  delivered by the private sector.</li><li>The arrangement is not covered by other  legislation that restricts or carves out Treasury Board authority to issue  administrative policy (e.g., federal-provincial agreements, the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em>,  treaties).</li><li>The arrangement uses capital or operations and  maintenance funding and not contribution funds (some vote wording permits  exceptions).</li><li>The planned arrangement is treated as a  procurement by a trade agreement.</li><li>The good, service or construction received is in  exchange for a monetary payment and is not a gift, volunteering, transfer,  trade, barter, exchange, expropriation, confiscation, spoil of war or inventory  adjustment. </li><li>The cost of the arrangement is tracked in  financial systems under an economic object that is aligned with procurement.</li><li>The arrangement is entitled or contains words  typical of a procurement, e.g., “contract,” “purchase order,” “call-up,” “the  contractor shall deliver,” etc.</li><li>The arrangement is signed by a contracting  authority.</li><li>The arrangement is within the mandate of the  contracting authority.</li></ul></div></section><section anchor="5.4" title="5.4 Public Works and Government Services Canada’s and Other Government Departments' Roles and Responsibilities"><p>Departments are reminded that under Section 9 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-38.2/">Department of Public  Works and Government Services Act</a></em>, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services has the  exclusive authority to acquire goods, with only a few exceptions. Similarly,  under the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/">Defence Production Act</a></em>,  the Minister of Public Works and Government Services had the exclusive authority to buy or otherwise acquire  defence supplies and construct defence projects.</p><p>It is a best practice to consult with legal advisors to  ensure that a department has the authority to enter into a contractual  arrangement for any goods, services or construction services. It is also  recommended that departments consult Public Works and Government Services Canada early in any process that may  involve an acquisition over $25,000 and that may be within Public Works and Government Services Canada’s purview.  Public Works and Government Services Canada will also require evidence that certification of expenditure initiation  under Section 32 of the FAA (e.g., a “funded” requisition, or the 9200 form) to  proceed with these arrangements.</p><p>Departments should consult with colleagues in other  departments early in the process of developing contractual arrangements,  particularly those that may involve possible future acquisitions or other  commitments. This is also important so that sufficient time can be allocated in  any critical path that requires Cabinet-level approvals or navigating Public Works and Government Services Canada’s  processes, as required.</p></section><section anchor="5.5" title="5.5 Contractual Arrangements That Have Multiple Activities"><p>Some relationships may involve other aspects beyond any  procurement of goods, services or construction services. This might include  personnel exchanges, research and development partnerships, sharing of data, or  other technical information or various other types of collaboration.  Arrangements to collaborate that have no procurement aspects in the short term  may also lead to procurement relationships in the medium or long term.</p><p>A best practice in these instances is to look at how  large a component the procurement aspect is (or may potentially become) as  compared with the overall scope of activities. If procurement is a significant  proportion of the related activity, or if it is risky or otherwise sensitive,  departments should consider processing the arrangement through their usual  procurement channels to ensure sufficient due diligence. These instances must  be treated on a case-by-case basis. Early engagement with departments’ legal,  procurement and financial expertise and with TBS can help determine the  required course of action. </p></section><section anchor="5.6" title="5.6 Financial Management and Payment Implications"><p>Departments are encouraged to structure arrangements so  that they certify that the goods or services procured have been received in  accordance with Section 34 of the FAA. This includes defining expected outcomes  and schedules of payment, and a description of the responsibilities of the  parties. This is important, as departments cannot legally make payments on  non-binding agreements unless they meet these standard obligations under  Section 34.</p><p>Where neither contracting nor transfer payment  models fit the planned approach, departments are encouraged to seek legal  advice early on in the development of the arrangement to ensure that they have  the legal authority in place to make payments. In some cases, an  order-in-council may be required.</p><div class="highlight"><h4>Financial management questions</h4><p>It may also be useful to determine the financial management  policy implications, and when it may be appropriate to use a contractual  arrangement, by asking the following questions:</p><ul><li>Is the transaction authorized under the legal  mandate of the department?</li><li>Against which appropriation will the expenditures  be charged (transfer payment or operational expenditures)?</li><li>Can the department make recoverable expenditures  under its legislative authorities?</li><li>Is it a transfer payment or is the government  receiving a good or service?</li><li>Is there a third party, and what is the nature  of the relationship and the rule that applies (contractor or recipients of a  transfer payment)?</li><li>How will requirements of Section 34 of the FAA  be met?</li></ul></div></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6.
