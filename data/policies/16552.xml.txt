value are created, acquired, captured, managed in departmental repositories and used as a strategic asset to support effective 
decision making and facilitate ongoing operations and the delivery of programs and services.</p><p><strong>3.2</strong> As a core resource management function within the Government of Canada, effective recordkeeping 
enables departments to manage their ongoing operations, deliver programs and services, and ensure key departmental capacities 
for accountability, stewardship, evaluation, audit, access to information, privacy, security and policy compliance.</p><p><strong>3.3</strong> Information resources of business value include published and unpublished materials, regardless 
of medium or form, that are created or acquired because they enable decision making and the delivery of programs, services

reliable evidence of business decisions, activities and transactions, for program managers, deputy heads, ministers, and 
Canadian citizens.</p><!-- <p><strong>3.4</strong> As stated in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12754"><em>Directive on Information
