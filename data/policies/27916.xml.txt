Context"><p>3.1  Every day, the Government of Canada delivers a broad range of services.  External services range from those that have a strong client orientation to those where the protection of the public interest is the primary focus. The delivery of external services relies on internal services, which support a public service that operates well.</p><p>3.2  Excellence in the design and delivery of services promotes confidence in government, and contributes to achieving public policy goals, outcomes as outlined in departmental Management Resources and Results Structures, efficient service delivery, and better service experiences for clients.</p><p>3.3  Clients expect effective services that are integrated, simple, timely and secure. To meet these expectations, consideration must be given to the needs and feedback of clients and the implementation of strong service management practices. </p><p>3.4  Delivering services more efficiently can be achieved by migrating clients to emerging and lower-cost channels, such as e-services, mobile e-services and social media, and through adopting alternative service delivery mechanisms and partnerships with other departments and jurisdictions. </p><p>3.5  Services are designed and delivered to reflect the equal status of English and French as the two official languages of Canada and obligations of the Government of Canada as set out in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-3.01/"><em>Official Languages Act</em></a>. Services are designed and delivered so as to be accessible to persons with disabilities, and personal information provided by clients is managed in the interests of protecting their personal information, in accordance with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>, and their privacy.</p><p>3.6  The design and delivery of services require consideration of client service (e.g., ease of access and use, accuracy, timeliness) and stewardship, security and integrity dimensions (e.g., provision of assurances that appropriate controls are in place).  Identity validation and the ability to securely interact with clients on-line play a critical role in a "tell us once" approach and in the delivery and uptake of e-services.</p><p>3.7  This policy is issued pursuant to section 7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>.</p><p>3.8  The Treasury Board has delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury Board the authority to issue, amend, and rescind directives and standards to support this policy.</p><p>3.9  This policy is to be read in conjunction with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578"><em>Policy on Government Security</em></a><em>,</em> the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12025"><em>Common Services Policy</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12316"><em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em></a>, the <a href="/rtrap-parfa/gispra-garmsar-eng.asp"><em>Guide on Improving Service Performance for Regulatory Authorizations</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26160"><em>Policy on Official Languages</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12236"><em>Policy on Service Standards for External Fees</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25687"><em>Standard on Enterprise Resource Planning Systems</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27088"><em>Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices</em></a>, and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24227"><em>Standard on Web Usability</em></a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
