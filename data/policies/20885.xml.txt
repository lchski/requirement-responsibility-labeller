when a capital asset is acquired, constructed, developed or already in operation; 
however, these costs are not settled until the capital asset is retired at the end 
of its useful life or at the end of the contractual term. Incurring future asset 
restoration costs must be the result of a contractual or legal obligation. Examples 
of such obligations include the need to restore the condition of a leased asset 
at the end of a lease agreement, the need to dispose of certain types of fuel storage 
tanks by regulation, the need to decontaminate certain waste materials before they 
are released or the need to decommission a nuclear facility.</p><p>Please note that this guidance provides further explanation for the application 
of Sections 22, 23, 24 and 25 of the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12176">Treasury 
Board Accounting Standard (TBAS) 3.1 – Capital Assets</a></em>, which has been in 
effect since March 29, 2001.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Recognition and measurement"><p>Only a legal or contractual obligation associated with the retirement of a capital 
asset that establishes a duty or responsibility to restore it justifies recognition 
of a liability. These liabilities may encompass costs for dismantling, abandoning, 
cleaning up or restoring a capital asset. When such costs can be reasonably estimated:</p><ol><li>They shall be added to the carrying value of the 
capital asset and amortized over the remainder of its useful life; and,</li><li>An allowance for the estimated costs for future asset 
restoration shall be recorded as a liability.</li></ol><p>If future asset restoration costs are expected to be significant but cannot be 
reasonably estimated, this factshall be disclosed in the notes to the departmental 
financial statements in accordance with <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12181">TBAS 3.6 – Contingencies</a></em>. </p><p>The rationale behind this accounting treatment is that the future asset restoration 
costs are linked to the use of the capital asset and shall therefore be recognized 
over the years of use rather than at the time the restoration work is performed.
</p><p>A department shall recognize the liability for future asset restoration costs 
in the period in which the capital asset is placed in service and when a reasonable 
estimate of the costs can be made. The initial estimated restoration cost shall 
be the fair value based on the best information available when the capital asset 
is initially placed in service, such as quoted current market prices in active markets 
or prices for similar work. If an estimated future cash requirement is provided 
for the future restoration cost, the estimated future cash flow shall be discounted 
at the Government of Canada lending rate to approximate the total fair value of 
the capital asset when the capital asset is placed in service as shown in
<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?section=text&amp;id=20885#appA">Appendix A</a>. </p><p>In subsequent years, a present value technique, inflated by the
<a href="http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/cpis01a-eng.htm">Consumer Price Index</a> 
(CPI), shall be applied to the opening liability balance in order to estimate the 
fair value of the closing liability at March 31 of each year (see Appendix B). While 
estimates shall be re-examined whenever circumstances that would likely affect the 
estimates occur or every few years, departments must ensure that at least a present 
value adjustment is done annually in the absence of any reassessment. In other words, 
departments are to factor in inflation to keep the estimates current.</p><p>For future restoration costs with estimated future cash flows spanning more than 
25 years, the 25-year <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/activty/lending_-eng.asp">Government 
of Canada lending rate</a> shall be used.</p><p>Please note that the future asset restoration costs to be capitalized exclude 
costs related to remediation liabilities for contaminated sites and solid waste 
landfills. Please see guidance onRemediation Liability for Contaminated Sites.</p><p>Upon transition to this guidance, the fair value of the estimated restoration 
cost of an asset at the time of the adoption of this guidance shall be added to 
the carrying value of the asset already in service and amortized over the remainder 
of its useful life.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Disclosures"><p>The following information regarding future asset restoration costs shall be disclosed:</p><ol><li>A general description of the future asset restoration

will remain until the restoration work is performed 10 years later. Since the department 
has not yet paid for the tower, a payable must be recorded for the amount owing
