Streamlining of Reporting and Statutory Annual Reports.</div></notetoreader><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="Purpose"><p>This documentis intended to assist departmental officials as well as Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) officials in the 
interpretation and application of section 157 of the <em>Financial Administration Act </em>(FAA). </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Background"><p>Under <em>section 157 of </em>the FAA, statutory reports required by Parliament, or to be submitted to Parliament, can 
be discontinued by Order in Council (OIC) when they contain the same or less information than is contained in Public Accounts 
or Estimates documents, namely the <em>Report on Plans and Priorities</em> and the <em>Departmental Performance Report</em>.</p><p>This integration or streamlining of reporting must be in accord with the purpose, policies and basic disclosure principles 
and standards for the various reporting instruments (i.e., Part III of the Estimates and the Public Accounts), and must 
respect legislated requirements.</p><p>There must be no loss of information to Parliament.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Application"><p>These guidelines apply to all departments required to produce Part III of the Estimates and the Public Accounts.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Implementation procedures"><p>For the purpose of integration, the information contained in the Estimates documents or Public Accounts is compared to 
that contained in the statutory annual report to determine whether the latter report may be discontinued. The various reporting 
instruments are described in Appendix A.</p><p>This process can take a complete reporting cycle leading to the required Governor-in-Council approval. The main steps 
to follow in order to reach final approval are:</p><ul><li>Departments and agencies contact their TBS program sector analyst to discuss 
their requests for TBS to examine the potential streamlining of statutory annual reports.</li><li>TBS formally reviews the information in the Estimates documents or Public 
Accounts and in the statutory report in order to ensure that there is no loss of information to Parliament.</li><li>If the TBS review is favourable, a letter of attestation must be sent from 
the responsible minister to the President of the Treasury Board. The letter will request a potential discontinuance of the 
report and indicate that there is no loss of information to Parliament. The letter must also refer to the TBS's formal review.</li><li>The President of the Treasury Board will then recommend to the Governor in 
Council that an OIC be made directing the discontinuance of the statutory report. Note that a Treasury Board submission 
is not needed in this case; a recommendation letter is sufficient. </li></ul><p>If the statutory information is not already in the Estimates documents or the Public Accounts, organizations could consider 
the following process during a first cycle for potential discontinuance of the report in a subsequent cycle:</p><ul><li>The statutory report to be eliminated or integrated should be adjusted or 
edited to take out information inconsistent with its defined purpose and scope. </li><li>When such information is of public relations or communications value, it 
could be published in alternative non-statutory publications such as an annual review, a departmental newsletter, a news 
release, etc. </li><li>Suitable information would be transferred to the Estimates documents or the 
Public Accounts and also be retained in the report to be eliminated. </li></ul><p>The streamlining of a statutory annual report can be initiated at any time during the year. </p><p>Departments and agencies planning to integrate statutory reports with the Estimates documents or the Public Accounts 
are advised to consult with TBS early in the process.</p><p>The department or agency must continue to produce the annual report until the Governor in Council has approved discontinuance 
of the statutory report by OIC. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Consolidated reports"><p>Some departments and agencies have consolidated statutory reports in their Estimates documents or Public Accounts (see 
Appendix B). They must ensure that their Estimates documents or the Public Accounts continue to contain the statutory information 
previously contained in the annual statutory report, when the legislation requiring this annual report is still in effect.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="References"><p>The following are general references:</p><p>Section 157 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/59494.html">Financial Administration Act</a></em></p><p>Individual departmental legislation will provide the requirements for statutory reports to Parliament.</p><p>These guidelines replace:</p><p>The <em>Policy on Streamlining Statutory Reporting </em>in the Chapter 5-10 of the "Comptrollership" volume of the
<em>Treasury Board Manual</em> dated October 1, 1994.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="Enquiries"><p>To discuss potential streamlining of reports, please contact:</p><div class="indent1"><address>Program Sector <br />

Part I provides 
an overview of federal spending and summarizes the relationship of the key elements of the Main Estimates to the current 
Expense Plan.  Part II directly supports the <em>Appropriation Act</em>. The Main Estimates identify the spending authorities 
(Votes) and amounts to be included in subsequent appropriation bills. Part III is divided into two components: the Reports 
on Plans and Priorities and the Departmental Performance Reports.</p></section><section anchor="A.2" title="Public accounts"><p>This is the report of the Government of Canada prepared each fiscal year by the Receiver General as required by section 
64 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>. Public Accounts provide a detailed accounting of government expenditures 
in relation to Estimates previously voted by Parliament.</p></section><section anchor="A.3" title="Departmental annual report"><p>A departmental annual report (DAR) is a report on operations for the most recently completed fiscal year that a minister 
is required, by the department's enabling statute, to table before Parliament at a designated time.</p><p>As a rule, legislation does not specify content requirements for DARs; however, the focus of the DAR should be a concise, 
factual account of the institution's work during the subject year and the results achieved. Promotional material and matters 
of local interest should be excluded.<strong><sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnr1">[1]</a></sup></strong></p><p>This interpretation reflects the same results orientation as Part III of the Estimates.</p></section><section anchor="A.4" title="Other statutory reports"><p>Other statutory reports for specific elements of a department's operations, or for boards, commissions, etc., that have 
not been created as separate departments may also be required to be tabled by the same minister. The focus is on specific 
legislative requirements.</p></section><section anchor="A.5" title="Other annual reports"><p>Non-statutory annual reports are published at a department's discretion and cannot be substituted for statutory reports, 
nor can they be combined with an annual report. The focus of other annual reports is usually the information needs of special 
or general client groups. They may also contain information of a local or public relations nature.</p><p>Departments or agencies wishing to streamline their DARs to better reflect the intended purpose of these publications 
can transfer promotional information to a non-statutory annual report.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B – List of Discontinued Reports"><p>The following statutory reports have been discontinued. The titles of the reports and the organizations' name are shown
