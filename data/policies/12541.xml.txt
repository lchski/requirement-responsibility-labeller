This policy outlines the principal steps necessary to attain the goal of a representative Public Service that includes persons with disabilities.</p><p>This policy is consistent with fundamental Canadian legal principles. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees certain democratic rights to all persons and prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical or mental disability. In several cases, Canadian courts have emphasized that accommodation is an essential means of ensuring the equal participation of all persons in all sectors of Canadian society.</p><p>Under the Canadian Human Rights Act, employers must accommodate individuals and groups of individuals to the point of undue hardship considering issues of health, safety and cost.</p><p>The Employment Equity Act requires the reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities and others within the federal workplace. The Act also requires employers to identify and remove barriers to the employment of persons in designated groups.</p><p>Under the Employment Equity Act, the Treasury Board and the Public Service Commission share employer responsibilities to the extent of their authority under the Financial Administration Act and the Public Service Employment Act. This policy therefore sets out the requirements for the Treasury Board, the Public Service Commission and their delegates.</p><p>Annex A provides guidelines to help in the interpretation of this policy. These guidelines may be updated periodically based on experience in applying the policy.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Effective date"><p>This policy becomes effective June 3, 2002. It replaces the Treasury Board Policy on the Provision of Accommodation to Employees with Disabilities dated July 1, 1999.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Policy objectives"><p>This policy's goal is to ensure the full participation of persons with disabilities in the federal Public Service whether as candidates for employment or as employees.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Policy statement"><p>It is the policy of the Treasury Board and the Public Service Commission to create and maintain an inclusive, barrier-free environment in the federal Public Service to ensure the full participation of persons with disabilities. This policy is to be implemented by:</p><ul><li>identifying and removing barriers to employment, career development and promotion of persons with disabilities unless doing so would result in undue hardship</li><li>designing all employment systems, processes and facilities to be accessible by building accommodation into workplace standards, systems, processes and facilities and</li><li>accommodating individuals when such barriers cannot be removed. Such accommodation must be made to the point of undue hardship taking into consideration issues of health, safety and cost.

They may review questions of policy interpretation or clarification with the Employment Equity Division of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat or with the Public Service Commission.</p><p>Information may also be obtained from the Treasury Board Secretariat Employment Equity Division's Web site at the following address: <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12543">http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12543</a> or from the PSC Web site at <a href="http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/">http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca</a></p></chapter></chapters><appendices><appendix anchor="A" title="Annex A - Guidelines"><p>These guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive, but offer some suggestions on how to interpret and implement this policy.</p><p>As stated in the preamble, the Treasury Board and the Public Service Commission are committed to an inclusive and barrier-free work environment in which all persons have equal access to opportunities in the federal Public Service and appointments are based on merit. Creating such a work environment requires that differences are accommodated before the merit assessment is undertaken and that assessment and evaluation tools are inclusive and barrier-free.</p><p>According to the Supreme Court of Canada, barriers to participation for persons with disabilities must be eliminated from policies, rules, standards and practices at the design stage. Employers cannot rely on accommodating individuals after the fact but must build accommodation into their policies or practices, as far as possible, to the point of undue hardship. If provision for accommodation has not been incorporated into the policy or standard then the policy or standard is not a bona fide 
occupational requirement.</p><p>The corporate culture of a department or agency can ensure that persons with disabilities feel welcome in that environment. Training should be made available to managers and others, such as selection board members, on the duty to accommodate.</p><p>The accommodation process should be as uncomplicated as possible and should respect the dignity and privacy of the person being accommodated. This can be accomplished if, at the time any person applies for a position, he or she is asked whether or not accommodation is required. The inquiry should be made again at the time of appointment or at the beginning of any other staffing process.</p><p>Under certain circumstances, employers may be required to offer accommodation to an employee even though the employee has not requested accommodation. Such situations should be handled with the utmost consideration for the privacy and dignity of the employee and managers may wish to obtain confidential, expert advice from within their departments or from the Treasury Board Secretariat or the Public Service Commission before proceeding.</p><p>A request for accommodation need not be in writing, but should be communicated as clearly and specifically as possible. The person to whom the request has been directed should do the following.</p><ol><li>Determine the type of accommodation required, based on information provided by the candidate or employee.</li><li>If the candidate or employee does not know what type of accommodation is required, consult experts in the field to determine the appropriate accommodation. This could include the person's own physician, psychologist or centres of expertise within the Public Service Commission or the accommodating department.</li><li>Provide the accommodation based on the request of the person being accommodated, or, if necessary, on the advice of experts.</li></ol><p>Persons requesting accommodation may be asked to provide documentation from a qualified health care professional to clarify the limitations caused by the disability and/or the type of accommodation that would be most effective. Any medical records provided should be kept strictly confidential and separate from personnel files. Requests for this type of information should come from personnel designated to deal with accommodation requests and trained to handle potentially sensitive medical information.</p><p>Departments and agencies are expected to integrate into their budgets and financial planning exercises the resources necessary to accommodate their employees. When considering cost, it should be kept in mind that in many cases the cost will be amortized over the employee's entire career. Also, there are many payment options available, include leasing, for any necessary equipment.</p><p>Departments and agencies should develop their own internal procedures for dealing with accommodation requests, including mechanisms for resolving situations where accommodation is denied. All candidates and employees should be advised of such procedures.</p><p>Persons who are denied accommodation may also wish to use the recourse mechanisms set out in the Public Service Employment Act, or contact the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</p><p>To implement employment equity, the federal Public Service encourages and promotes members of designated groups to identify themselves. However, an employee does not have to self-identify as a person with a disability in order to be accommodated or to have accommodation offered to him or her. The self-identification process is voluntary and the information obtained from it is confidential. No one can be forced to self-identify to receive accommodation or after he or she has been accommodated.</p><p>Although this policy applies only to employees of, and candidates for positions in, the federal Public Service, managers and others are expected to abide by the spirit of the policy when dealing with other persons who work for the federal Public Service, such as students and locally engaged staff.</p><h3>Examples of Disabilities</h3><p>Determining what is a disability depends on the circumstances of each case. The following have been found to be disabilities:</p><ul><li>blindness or other severe visual impairment</li><li>deafness or other severe hearing impairment</li><li>mobility impairment</li><li>chronic pain</li><li>environmental sensitivities</li><li>addictions</li><li>learning disabilities</li><li>speech impairment</li><li>chronic conditions, such as diabetes</li><li>psychiatric disabilities</li><li>developmental disabilities</li><li>other permanent or temporary conditions that cause pain or limit or restrict activities</li></ul><h3>Examples of Accommodation</h3><p>During the selection process, a person's qualifications must be assessed after the person has been accommodated. Types of accommodation during the selection process may include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>providing information about the position in multiple formats for candidates who are blind or visually impaired,</li><li>ensuring that applicants who are deaf or hearing impaired can make inquiries via a TTY number or fax,</li><li>allowing extra time, where appropriate, for tests or exams and</li><li>ensuring that the interview site is physically accessible.</li></ul><p>Types of accommodation in the workplace may include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>attendant services,</li><li>adaptive technology,</li><li>changes to work sites,</li><li>flexible work arrangements, including but not limited to telework, task modifications or other alternative work arrangements,</li><li>converting printed matter to alternative media and reader services for employees who are blind,</li><li>providing work space and furnishings appropriate to the nature of the disability,</li><li>providing interpreters for deaf and hearing-impaired employees and</li><li>adapting training programs to the needs of employees with disabilities, including those with learning disabilities.</li></ul><p>Alternate formats can include:</p><ul><li>braille documents</li><li>large print documents</li><li>electronic versions of documents</li></ul><h3>Other Matters</h3><p>Attendant and other services</p><p>The contracting department should refer to the standard clauses established by Public Works and Government Services Canada for inclusion in contracts for attendant and other services.</p><p>Travel status</p><p>When employees with disabilities are on travel status and suitable attendant services cannot be provided, or the services of a travel companion are required, a separate contract may be necessary and the service shall be provided at the department's expense.</p><p>Parking requirements</p><p>Departments and agencies are responsible for setting parking rates for government-owned or leased parking lots. Departments should determine whether it is appropriate to charge parking fees to employees with a disability who are unable to use public transit, and, if so, what those fees should be.</p></appendix></appendices></doc>
