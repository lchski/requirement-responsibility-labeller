them to carry forward limited amounts of these funds into the next fiscal year.</p></section><section anchor="3.2" title="Objectives"><ol><li>To increase ministerial authority and accountability.</li><li>To improve cash management.</li><li>To enhance expenditure management in departments and agencies.</li><li>To increase value for money in contractual arrangements.</li><li>To improve administration.</li></ol></section><section anchor="3.3" title="Application"><p>The interim policy applies to departments and agencies that have separate capital votes in Main Estimates.

policy.</p></section><section anchor="3.6" title="Policy Details"><ol><li>Departments and agencies with separate capital votes in Main Estimates may, in certain circumstances, carry
forward up to 5% of a capital vote from one fiscal year to the next, to a maximum of $75 million.</li><li>The maximum of $75 million per capital vote will be phased in over three years. A maximum of $25 million for any
given vote can be carried forward into 1988-89, $50 million into 1989-90, and $75 million thereafter. The maximum
cannot be increased by unspent moneys carried forward from previous years, and cannot exceed 5% of the capital
vote.</li><li>With the agreement of the Secretary of the Treasury Board, the amount to be carried forward to the next fiscal
year will be placed in a frozen lapsing allotment in the current year.</li><li>The policy is not intended to carry forward amounts that would normally lapse. Carry forward proposals must be
related to specific capital plans, objectives and results and must be justified in relation to the principles outlines
in this interim policy.</li><li>The attached Appendix describes the procedures for implementing this policy. Except for proposals already
included in the 1988-89 Multi-Year Operational Plans, departments are expected to use this interim policy rather than
include similar proposals in their MYOPs.</li></ol></section><section anchor="3.7" title="Evaluation"><p>This policy will be evaluated within three to four years, at which time its continuation will be considered.</p></section><section anchor="3.8" title="Enquiries"><p>Enquiries should be directed to your department's Program Analyst, Program Branch, Treasury Board Secretariat.</p></section></chapter></chapters><appendices><appendix anchor="A" title="Appendix A - Implementation Procedures"><ol><li>By December 15 of each year, Deputy Heads must write to the Secretary of the Treasury Board requesting that
frozen lapsing allotments be established in the current year equal to any amounts they wish to carry forward into the
next fiscal year. they should explain clearly the circumstances surrounding the lapse, demonstrate the need to carry
moneys forward, and explain how these would eventually be spent.</li><li>Once the proposal is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury Board, the amounts to be carried forward will be
placed in frozen lapsing allotments for the current fiscal year, and the department will be so advised.</li><li>Under this interim policy, the department is then authorized to included these amounts in a Supplementary
Estimate for the following fiscal year. (i.e. in the overall Supplementary Estimates package signed by the Minister as
set out in Chapter IX of the Policy and Expenditure Management System Manual.)</li></ol></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B - Background"><ol><li>The Ministerial Task Force on Procurement concluded that annually lapsing appropriations contributed to
inefficiencies in the management of major Crown projects and, consequently, to a waster of government funds. The task
force indicated that some form of multi-year funding might introduce a degree of flexibility to alleviate the concerns
raised in their report.</li><li>Accordingly, Cabinet commissioned the President of the Treasury Board, in consultation with the Ministers of
Defence, Transport and Finance and with the advice of the Comptroller General, to report to the Treasury Board on:
"ways and means of establishing multi-year, non-lapsing authorities for specified major Crown projets or capital
acquisition programs".</li><li>An interdepartmental committee assessed the conclusions of a study of Multi-Year Funding Options for Capital
Programs and developed a recommendation to establish a limited carry-forward mechanism providing funding flexibility
for certain capital programs. This committee was chaired by the Office of the Comptroller General and included senior
officers from the Treasury Board Secretariat, the Department of Finance and departments with major multi-year project
responsibilities.</li><li>At its meeting of July 15, 1987, Treasury Board considered and approved, on a pilot basis, a policy to establish
a limited carry-forward of capital funds.</li></ol></appendix></appendices></doc>
