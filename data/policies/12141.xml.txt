Introduction"><p>The new <em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=26#2">Public Service
  Labour Relations Act</a></em>  (PSLRA) recognises the concept of two-tier bargaining. The concept permits
  the parties to utilise flexible approaches in negotiating collective agreements.
  The adoption of such approaches is voluntary and, thus, subject to the agreement
  of the Employer and the bargaining agent.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Legislative base"><p>The <em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=26#2">Public Service
  Labour Relations Act</a></em> (PSLRA, Section 110; as promulgated by the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/P-33.4/index.html">Public
  Service Modernization Act</a></em> contains a new provision that recognises
  the practice of two-tier bargaining. The parties to collective agreements have
  always had the ability to utilise this approach. The new provision serves to
  highlight the desirability of employing it in the bargaining process in order to
  focus on concerns specific to departments.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Application"><p>These guidelines apply to departments and agencies listed under Schedules I and IV
  of the <em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=668#192">Financial
  Administration Act</a></em> and for which Treasury Board is identified as the
  Employer.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Terminology"><p>The definitions of various terms (e.g., bargaining agent, bargaining unit,
  board (PSLRB), employee, employer) used throughout these guidelines are found in
  the <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=26#2" title="PUBLIC SERVICE LABOUR RELATIONS ACT">PSLRA</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. What is two-tier bargaining"><p>The Employer and the bargaining agent negotiate the collective agreement and
  are the parties to the agreement. Two-tier bargaining is a mechanism that permits
  the Employer and the bargaining agent to focus on and tailor terms and conditions
  of the agreement to specific situations in a given department or departments. The
  Employer, as part of this process, may delegate to a department the authority to
  conduct the negotiations, if the bargaining agent has agreed to negotiate on that
  basis. In any case, the parties to the agreement remain as noted above.</p><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 Ground rules for embarking on a two-tier bargaining process"><p>In that part of the Public Service for which Treasury Board is the Employer,
  the parties to any collective agreement are the Treasury Board and the bargaining
  agent representing the particular bargaining unit to which the agreement applies.
  (see the list of current bargaining agents in Annex A).</p><p>If the Employer and the bargaining agent agree to proceed in this fashion with
  respect to one or more issues or situations in relation to the negotiation a of a
  collective agreement, the two parties, prior to entering into detailed discussions
  on the issues, will agree upon a protocol which will govern how the two-tier
  process is to work.</p><p>The protocol will specify who will represent the parties in that particular
  circumstance and define their respective roles, responsibilities and authorities.
  Protocols may vary depending on the issues and the situations for which a two-tier
  process is being proposed.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. References"><ul class="noBullet index"><li><em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=852#252">Public Service
