Context"><p>These guidelines replace the <em>Guidelines for Discipline</em> issued on
April 1, 2005.</p><p>Paragraph
12(1)<em>(c</em>) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/F-11/index.html"><em>Financial Administration Act
(FAA)</em></a> authorizes every deputy head in the core public administration to
establish standards of discipline and to set penalties, including termination of
employment, suspension, demotion to a position at a lower maximum rate of pay,
and financial penalties that may be applied for breaches of discipline or
misconduct. Subsection 12(3) provides, among other things, that
disciplinary action shall be for cause. Finally subsection 12.2(1) permits
delegation of these authorities.</p><p>These
guidelines support the principles set out in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=19134"><em>Policy Framework for People
Management</em></a> by providing advice that will foster sound people management
practices across the core public administration. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Target Audience and Purpose"><p>These
guidelines assist human resources advisors in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.3/section-2.html">core public administration</a> in their role of
providing advice and guidance to management in the application of discipline,
in the development of departmental codes of discipline, and in the conduct of
disciplinary investigations and hearings.</p><p>The nature
of discipline is to be corrective, rather than punitive, and its purpose is to
motivate employees to accept those rules and standards of conduct that are
desirable or necessary to achieve the organization's goals and objectives.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. General"><p>Under
subsection 12.2(1) of the FAA, management is responsible and accountable for
the imposition of discipline. Typically, the level of management involved is
commensurate with the severity of the disciplinary measure. Managers can be
referred by human resources advisors to the guidance provided in Appendix A and
can consult with their human resources advisor, their labour relations
specialist, or both at the earliest indication that misconduct may have
occurred. Furthermore, management can refer to the following website devoted to
<a href="/tou/pmc-dgr/intro-eng.asp">performance management</a>.</p><p>It is
recommended that codes of discipline developed by human resources advisors or
management be based on sound managerial practices. When new codes of discipline
or any significant amendments to an existing code are developed, a draft copy
may be forwarded to the Treasury Board Secretariat's (TBS's) Employer
Representation in Recourse Section for consultation before promulgation.</p><p>Upon
request, TBS's Employer Representation in Recourse Team is available to provide
advice and guidance on termination
of employment or demotion or other disciplinary actions.  </p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Definitions - Disciplinary measures"><p>In order of
increasing severity, disciplinary measures are as follows:</p><dl><dt><strong>oral reprimand</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>réprimande verbale</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>A verbal
disciplinary measure that includes a statement outlining to the employee the nature
of the misconduct, the corrective action required, and the consequences should
it not be corrected. No record of this measure is placed on the employee's
personnel file.</p></dd><dt><strong>written
reprimand</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>réprimande écrite</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>A
formal written notice that misconduct has occurred. It outlines the nature of
the misconduct, the corrective action required, and the consequences should it
not be corrected. If more severe disciplinary action should later become
necessary, the record of the reprimand or reprimands on the personnel file
demonstrates that the employee was made aware of the consequences of further
misconduct.</p></dd><dt><strong>suspension</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>suspension</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>The temporary removal of
the employee from the place of work without pay as a consequence of misconduct.
The notice of suspension includes the nature of the misconduct, the corrective
action required, and the consequences should it not be corrected.</p></dd><dt><strong>financial
penalty</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>sanction pécuniaire</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>An
alternative to a suspension, where a financial penalty is considered preferable
for operational or economic reasons. Financial penalties are appropriate in
situations involving mass unlawful withdrawal of services, continuous shift
operations, ships at sea, or isolated posts where it may be difficult to schedule
suspensions without the use of replacements and overtime. It may also be used
to impose a definitive disciplinary measure for an act of misconduct. The
notice of financial penalty outlines the nature of the misconduct, the
corrective measure required, and the consequences
should it not be corrected.</p></dd><dt><strong>demotion</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>rétrogradation</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>An action taken by
the employer to appoint an employee to a position at a lower maximum rate of
pay. Demotion is an alternative to a disciplinary termination and may be used
when the manager is of the opinion that, despite the misconduct, the employee
is still suitable for continued employment, albeit in a position at a lower
maximum rate of pay. Demotion could be used in situations where a manager is
found guilty of harassment and is moved to a position with no managerial
responsibilities.</p></dd><dt><strong>termination</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>licenciement</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>The separation of an
employee from the core public administration for misconduct. Termination may be
used after a series of acts of misconduct when a culminating incident has
occurred or for a single act of serious misconduct. Termination is the most
severe disciplinary measure, and the decision to proceed is taken only after
careful consideration and when it is determined that the employee is no longer
suitable for continued employment by reason of misconduct.</p></dd></dl></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Redress"><p>An employee
who is disciplined as described in these guidelines is entitled to present an
individual grievance at each of the levels in the grievance process, up to and
including the final level, under the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/SOR-2005-79/index.html"><em>Public
Service Labour Relations Board Regulations</em></a></em> and the
provisions of any applicable collective agreement. Individual grievances may
also be subject to third-party adjudication, under paragraph 209(1)<em>(b)</em>
of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/P-33.3/index.html"><em>Public Service

    a fair and objective investigation as expeditiously as possible. </li><li>
    Establish
    whether the employee has been accorded due administrative process
    (see "Investigations and interviews" below). </li><li>

    Conduct
    an investigation into the alleged misconduct as soon as possible after the
    relevant incident. </li><li>
    Conduct
    the investigation fairly and objectively and consider and provide the
    following: 
    <ul><li>
        Background
        information leading to the relevant incident; </li><li>
        Input
        from the witness or witnesses; </li><li>
        The employee's
        response to the allegation(s); </li><li>
        An
        analysis of the facts; and </li><li>
        The
        conclusion as to whether misconduct has taken place. </li></ul></li></ul><p>In
  the context of administrative due process, employees have a right to be
  informed of the alleged wrongdoing and to have an opportunity to respond.
  Interviews with employees normally take place in private. Managers are
  encouraged to consult the applicable collective agreement and to advise the
  employee of the provisions respecting the attendance of a union representative
  or other representative at the interview. Management may also choose to be
  accompanied by a human resources advisor or another management colleague during
  the interview. Documentation of the outcome of the interview, including the
  investigation report if there is one, is retained and made available to the
  employee.</p><p>Note that a suspension
may be imposed pending investigation of certain suspected misconduct when the
presence of the employee at work cannot be tolerated or could undermine or impede
theinvestigation.
(See Appendix B for indefinite suspension principles as enunciated in the
Public Service Staff Relations Board decision 2002 PSSRB 9, <strong><br /></strong><em><a href="http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/decisions/summaries/30267-eng.asp">Larson
v. Treasury Board(Solicitor
General Canada - Correctional Service)</a></em>.</p></li><li><strong> Determining appropriate disciplinary action</strong><p>Each
incident of alleged misconduct is considered on the basis of individual merit. Based
on the circumstances, in management's opinion, what corrective measures are
necessary to correct the undesirable behaviour? The application of disciplinary
measures is not to be punitive. In the event that previous efforts to correct
behaviour have not achieved the desired results, or if the misconduct of the
employee is deemed so egregious that continued employment is not considered
feasible, termination action may be the only meaningful, appropriate measure. </p><p>Mitigating
circumstances, such as the employee's length of service, past record, the
seriousness of the offence, and the unique circumstances of each situation, may
require variations in management's response to seemingly similar offences.
Whatever the response, disciplinary actions depend on the nature of the
offence, the attendant circumstances, and any mitigating factors. Consultation
with your labour relations specialist may also be appropriate, and a review of
applicable jurisprudence is advisable. </p><p>It
is strongly advised not to delay disciplinary action; a lengthy time gap
between the breach of discipline and management's response tends to dissociate
the offence from the corrective action. Such delay may also be considered as
condoning the offence and may weaken management's case at adjudication. </p></li><li><strong>Flexibility and application of discipline</strong><p>It is
recommended to avoid the rigid equation of offences and disciplinary measures.
Disciplinary action of a progressively more serious nature may be warranted
when there are repeated incidents of misconduct.</p></li><li><strong>Meeting at which a disciplinary decision is rendered</strong><p>Please be
mindful of the principles of procedural fairness. According to these
principles, once a decision on disciplinary action is made, an employee should
be informed of this decision at a disciplinary meeting as soon as practicable.
Managers should consult the applicable collective agreement and advise the
employee of the provisions relating to the attendance of a bargaining agent or
other representative at the meeting. An employee should be informed of the
following during a disciplinary meeting:</p><ul><li>The disciplinary
    measure or measures to be taken; </li><li>The reasons the
    disciplinary measure was chosen; </li><li>The mitigating
    circumstances and the contributing factors that were taken into consideration
    in reaching this decision; </li><li>The manner and the
    time frame in which the disciplinary measure or measures will be administered
    in cases involving suspension, financial penalty, demotion and termination; and
  </li><li>The right to present
    an individual grievance.</li></ul><p>Applicable
  collective agreements may also require management to inform local union
  representatives when taking specific forms of disciplinary action. At the
  disciplinary hearing, an employee should be provided with a written statement
  of the disciplinary action to be taken.</p><p>The
Supreme Court of Canada decision in <em><a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/1999/1999scr2-817/1999scr2-817.html">Baker v.
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration)</a></em>, [1999]2 S.C.R.
817, sheds additional light on the principles of procedural fairness:</p><p>The
duty of procedural fairness is flexible and variable and depends on an
appreciation of the context of the particular statute and the rights affected. The
purpose of the participatory rights contained within it is to ensure that
administrative decisions are made using a fair and open procedure, appropriate
to the decision being made and its statutory, institutional and social context,
with an opportunity for those affected to put forward their views and evidence
fully and have them considered by the decision maker.</p></li><li><strong> Documentation</strong><p>A written
record of the disciplinary action taken should be placed on an employee's
personnel file. With respect to discipline, only documentation that the
employee is aware of can be placed on his or her personnel file. Failure on the
part of an employee to acknowledge disciplinary documentation being placed on
file may be substituted by a notation to that effect. Any document or written
statement related to a disciplinary action which may have been placed on the
personnel file of an employee shall be destroyed in compliance with the
applicable provision of the collective agreement or in compliance with section
4 of the <em>Privacy Regulations</em>. </p></li></ol></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B — Indefinite Suspension Principles for Consideration by Delegated Managers"><p>Adjudicators
have considered the following principles fromthe Public Service Staff
Relations Board decision 2002 PSSRB 9<em>, <a href="http://www.pslrb-crtfp.gc.ca/decisions/summaries/30267-eng.asp">Larson v.
Treasury Board(Solicitor General Canada - Correctional
Service)</a></em>, in determining whether an indefinite suspension was
justified: </p><ol><li>
    The issue
    in a grievance of this nature is not whether the grievor is guilty or innocent,
    but rather whether the presence of the grievor as an employee of the
    organization can be considered to present a reasonably serious and immediate
    risk to the legitimate concerns of the employer; </li><li>
    The onus
    is on the [employer] to satisfy the board of the existence of such a risk and
    the simple fact that a criminal charge has been laid is not sufficient to
    comply with that onus. The [employer] must also establish that the nature of
    the charge is such as to be potentially harmful or detrimental or adverse in
    effect to the [employer's] reputation or product or that it will render the
    employee unable properly to perform his duties or that it will have a harmful
    effect on other employees of the company or its customers or will harm the
    general reputation of the [employer]; </li><li>
    The
    [employer] must show that it did, in fact, investigate the criminal charge to
    the best of its abilities in a genuine attempt to assess the risk of continued
    employment. The burden, in this area, on the [employer] is significantly less
    in the case where the police have investigated the matter and have acquired the
    evidence to lay the charge than in the situation where the [employer] has initiated
    proceedings; </li><li>
    There is
    further onus on the [employer] to show that it has taken reasonable steps to
    ascertain whether the risk of continued employment might be mitigated through
    such techniques as closer supervision or transfer to another position; and </li><li>
    There is
    a continued onus on the part of the [employer] during the period of suspension
    to consider objectively the possibility of reinstatement within a reasonable
    period of time following suspension in light of new facts or circumstances
    which may come to the attention of the [employer] during the course of the
    suspension. These matters, again, must be evaluated in the light of the
    existence of a reasonable risk to the legitimate interest of the [employer]. </li></ol></appendix></appendices></doc>
