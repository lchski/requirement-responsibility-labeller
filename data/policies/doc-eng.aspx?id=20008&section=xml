<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><doc title="Guideline on the Management of Public Key Infrastructure in the Government of Canada" documentID="20008" versionID="1" language="en" space="preserve" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="PolicyInstrumentSchema.xsd"><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="1.&#xA;Context"><p>On July 1, 2009, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12616&amp;section=text">Policy
for Public Key Infrastructure Management in the Government of Canada</a> (PKI
Policy) was rescinded.   This guideline is intended to help
departments and program managers understand how the responsibilities and
practices which were established by the PKI Policy are governed under the
requirements of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578">Policy on
Government Security</a> (PGS).  </p><p>The guideline describes recommended practices for the
governance and management of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) within the
Government of Canada (GC) and provides operational guidance.  This
guideline does not include technical advice, guidance or requirements on the
implementation of public key technology by GC departments and agencies.</p><p>The PKI Policy was established to implement the position of
the GC that public key technology would be the preferred means by which the GC
would electronically authenticate the identity of entities or persons and
enhance the integrity and confidentiality of documents.  </p><p>As part of the renewed policy suite initiative, the PKI
Policy was rescinded to align responsibilities and accountabilities for secure
electronic transactions under the PGS and its supporting instruments. 
This will ensure a consistent approach to supporting the secure electronic
business of government.  It enables options for electronic authentication,
which should permit the GC to achieve security and identity outcomes while also
providing the flexibility for departments and agencies to utilise technologies
best suited to their specific business requirements.  </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2.&#xA;Governance of PKI in the Government of Canada"><p>Whereas the PKI Policy previously promoted the use of public
key technology, the PGS and its supporting instruments are intended to be
technology neutral.  In order to achieve the GC's desired security
outcomes of assuring that information, assets, services and interactions are
protected against compromise, the PGS, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16579">Directive on Departmental Security
Management</a> (DDSM) and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16577&amp;section=text">Directive on Identity Management</a> (DIDM) outline the
GC-wide requirements for establishing risk management-based processes by which
departments and agencies can effectively address their security and identity
risks. </p><p>Standards and guidelines that support the PGS and its
directives serve to promote common and/or best practices across the GC, but do
not seek to prescribe the specific method, solution, tool or technology that
departments and agencies are required to employ in order to meet security
control objectives.  As a result, <strong>departments now have greater
discretion in selecting technologies that best meet their needs; PKI is one of
the available options.</strong></p><section anchor="2.1" title="2.1 Applicable Legislation and Regulations"><p>This section identifies, at a high level, the federal
electronic signature and electronic documents legislation.  This is a
non-exhaustive list.  <strong><em>Departments should consult their departmental
legal services unit to determine which, if any, legislation applies to their
specific uses.</em></strong></p><p>Part 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-8.6/">Personal
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> (PIPEDA) provides an
opt-in framework that describes electronic alternatives to the use of paper to
record or communicate information or transactions, where the use of paper is
contemplated by statutes or regulations (e.g. when a federal law refers to
"originals", "statements under oath", "solemn
affirmation",  "declarations of truth, or accuracy or
completeness", "documents under seal" and "witnessed
documents").  </p><p>Section 31.4 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-5/20090818/en?page=1">Canada
Evidence Act</a> (CEA) provides the Governor in Council with a power
to make regulations establishing evidentiary presumptions in relation to
electronic documents signed with secure electronic signatures.</p><p>The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/SOR-2005-30/20090818/en?page=1">Secure
Electronic Signature Regulations</a> (SES Regulations) adopted
pursuant to PIPEDA and the CEA prescribe the technology and process required
for the implementation of secure electronic signatures and establish the
evidentiary presumptions applicable when the prescribed technology and process
were used in respect of data contained in an electronic document.</p><p>Additional information on secure electronic signatures can
be found under the "Recognition" section of these guidelines.</p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="2.2&#xA;Applicable Policies, Directives and Standards"><p>This section identifies and describes applicable policies,
directives and standards that should be consulted by departments in deciding
whether to implement a PKI to meet their needs.  Relevant sections of
these documents have been quoted for ease of reference; however it is
recommended that readers consult the original documents for full context.</p><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578&amp;section=text">PGS</a>
identifies, at a high level, the need for establishing trust in interactions
for government services and programs without prescribing the mechanisms for
doing so:</p><div class="indent1"><p><em>Security begins by establishing trust in
interactions between government and Canadians and within government.</em><a href="#fn1" title="See Footnote 1" id="fnr1" name="fnr1"><strong><em>[1]</em></strong></a></p></div><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16579&amp;section=text#appC">Appendix
C of the DDSM</a> provides the direction that departments have the
responsibility for selecting appropriate security controls to meet their needs:</p><div class="indent1"><p><em>Departments are responsible for selecting,
implementing, monitoring and maintaining sustainable security controls to
achieve the security control objectives. Security controls may be
administrative, managerial, operational, technical or procedural. Mandatory and
recommended security controls are specified in standards and guidelines that
support the Policy on Government Security. Additional security controls and
control objectives are selected and implemented by departments based on the results
of risk assessments.</em><a href="#fn2" title="See Footnote 2" id="fnr2" name="fnr2"><strong><em>[2]</em></strong></a></p></div><p>The DDSM goes into greater specificity on the
responsibilities for selecting security controls and assessing and accepting
residual risk levels for programs and services.  The DDSM states that
departmental security practitioners are responsible for:</p><div class="indent1"><p><em>Selecting, implementing and maintaining security
controls related to their area of responsibility to ensure that control
objectives are achieved.</em><a href="#fn3" title="See Footnote 3" id="fnr3" name="fnr3"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></a></p></div><p>Additionally, according to the DDSM, managers at all levels are responsible
for: </p><div class="indent1"><p><em>Assessing security risks, formally accepting
residual risks or recommending acceptance of residual risks as defined in the
Departmental Security Plan and periodically reassessing and re-evaluating risks
in light of changes to programs, activities or services and taking corrective
action to address identified deficiencies;</em><a href="#fn4" title="See Footnote 4" id="fnr4" name="fnr4"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></a></p></div><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12328">Operational Security
Standard: Management of IT Security</a> (MITS) expands on this
responsibility for program and service delivery managers within the realm of IT
security: </p><div class="indent1"><p><em>In designing programs and services, managers will
work with departmental security specialists to risk manage their programs or
services.  Relying on the advice and support of the IT Security
Coordinator, managers must determine the IT security requirements of their
programs and services, have them accredited, and accept the associated residual
risk.<a href="#fn5" title="See Footnote 5" id="fnr5" name="fnr5"><strong>[5]</strong></a></em></p></div><p>MITS further specifies responsibilities for certification
and accreditation of IT systems in the GC:  </p><div class="indent1"><p><em>For common systems or services, the Government of
Canada Chief Information Officer is the accreditation authority.  For
systems or services that are specific to a department, the program or service
delivery manager is responsible for accreditation.  For systems or
services shared by two or more organizations, the manager of the program or service
is the accreditation authority.</em><a href="#fn6" title="See Footnote 6" id="fnr6" name="fnr6"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></a></p></div><p>These responsibilities are applicable to the certification
and accreditation of PKI systems in the GC.  As a result, the responsible
program or service delivery manager should ensure (with the assistance of the
department's security practitioners) that any policies, processes, or
technologies implemented to provide assurance in the PKI system are appropriate
and sufficient when making their decision to accredit the system.</p><p>While previously the governance and management of PKI within
the GC was specifically defined by the mechanisms prescribed within the PKI
Policy, PKI is managed in accordance with the requirements of the PGS and
supporting GC security directives and standards (particularly MITS).  As a
result of rescinding the PKI Policy, departments who select PKI as an
appropriate security control should find that they have more flexibility in how
they manage their PKI.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3.&#xA;Management of PKI in the Government of Canada"><section anchor="3.1" title="3.1&#xA;Classes of Certification Authority in the Government of Canada"><h4>3.1.1 Common CA</h4><p>Within the GC, a common CA issues public key certificates
(PKC) on behalf of other departments or external users.  The <strong>Internal
Credential Management (ICM) Common Services CA</strong>, operated by PWGSC on behalf
of Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), is the approved common CA for departments
requiring PKI certificates for internal-to-government systems which contain
information up to and including the "Protected B" level.  Departments
should consult the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12025">Common Services
Policy</a> and the Departmental
Guide to Adoption of Secure Channel Mandatory Services to identify
mandatory uses of this service.  The ICM Common Services CA has been
recognized by the President of the Treasury Board in accordance with the SES
Regulations.</p><p>PWGSC also operates the <strong>Government On-Line (GOL) CA</strong>
service on behalf of TBS, for the issuance of certificates to
external-to-government users.  The GOL CA is approved for uses up to and
including the "Protected B" level of information.</p><p>Departments should contact their PWGSC client-services
representative to discuss their objectives and to identify whether these common
CAs can help to address the department's needs.  Where a departmental
requirement exists for a common CA that cannot be met by the ICM Common
Services CA, TBS should be contacted at the earliest possible opportunity to
identify the requirement and to specify why the ICM Common Services CA is not
sufficient.  Based on this information, a way forward will be identified,
as will roles and responsibilities for certification and accreditation of the
system.  A common CA should cross-certify through the Canadian Federal PKI
Bridge where practicable (see sections 3.1.3 and 3.2 below).</p><p>Departments or program managers wishing to establish a
common CA should:</p><ul><li>
    Contact the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20008&amp;section=text#cha6">Security and Identity Management Division</a>(SIDM)
    of the Chief Information Officer Branch (CIOB) at TBS to identify the
    department's requirement.</li><li>
    Ensure certification and accreditation plans are developed and forwarded
    to TBS for review prior to final accreditation.</li></ul><h4>3.1.2 Departmental
CA</h4><p>A <strong>Departmental CA</strong> is
used by a department to meet an internal requirement for which the GC ICM Common
Services CA is not mandatory (see the previous section on <strong>Common CA</strong>) and
for which the ICM Common Services CA cannot adequately meet the department's
needs. </p><p>For a Departmental CA, the department should ensure that
proper risk management has been performed on the system.  As per MITS, the
program or service delivery manager at that department is responsible for
accrediting the system.  Departments have the flexibility to develop
security requirements for Departmental CAs within their risk tolerances.
 It is recommended that industry best practices be followed in the
definition of security requirements.  It is also recommended that
departments align their Certificate Policies (CP) and practices with those used
by the Canadian Federal PKI Bridge where practicable and appropriate (see
section 3.1.3 below).</p><p>Examples of a Departmental CA may include:</p><ul><li>
    A CA intended for the issuance of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    certificates solely for internal departmental use (i.e. not for issuance to
    other departments or for public consumption);</li><li>A CA with specific trust requirements that precludes the use of a common
    CA; and,</li><li>A CA intended for the issuance of internal high-assurance certificates
    or for use within a closed (e.g. classified) system.</li></ul><p>It is recommended that departments or program managers
establishing a Departmental CA:</p><ul><li>
    Ensure that their requirements cannot be met by the GC Common CA by
    discussing with the department's PWGSC IT-SSO Client Relationship Manager;</li><li>
    Request an exemption for the CA from the Common Services Policy;</li><li>
    Contact Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) for guidance
    on cryptographic measures and key management, if needed;</li><li>
    Ensure that system certification and accreditation plans are developed
    and followed; and</li><li>
    Ensure that the CA is accredited in accordance with their departmental
    standard prior to being put into operation.</li></ul><h4>3.1.3 Bridge CA</h4><p>A Bridge CA (or PKI Bridge) is a CA which is used to
establish a relationship of trust between separate and distinct PKI
systems.  The trust relationship is created through a process of
cross-certification between different CAs.</p><p>Within the GC, the <strong>Canadian Federal PKI Bridge</strong> (CFPB)
is the approved Bridge CA.  It is operated by CSEC on behalf of TBS. </p></section><section anchor="3.2" title="3.2 Cross-Certification"><p>Cross-certification is a process undertaken by CAs to
establish a trust relationship. It involves one CA issuing a certificate to
another CA. Cross-certifications can also be combined, with the issuer and
subject or user roles of CAs being reversed (i.e. mutual
cross-certification).  When two CAs are mutually cross-certified, they agree
to trust and rely upon each other's PKC and keys as if they had issued the
certificates themselves.  GC departments with a requirement to
cross-certify their CA with another CA outside of their organization should do
so through the Canadian Federal PKI Bridge; this includes cross-certifications
between GC CAs and external to GC CAs.</p><p>The President of the Treasury Board, pursuant to authority
provided by Order in Council, may enter into or terminate an agreement for cross-certification
or recognition of a CA including those outside of the GC. The President of the
Treasury Board has delegated this authority to the Government of Canada Chief
Information Officer. </p><p>Overview of the Cross-Certification Process:</p><ul><li>
    The requestor should determine the business requirement for
    cross-certifying with the CFPB.</li><li>
    The requestor submits a request to CIOB.</li><li>
    If the organization is external to the GC, a GC department will be required
    as a sponsor.</li><li>
    Certificate Policies of the requesting CA will be examined to ensure
    alignment with those of the CFPB.</li><li>
    Test-bed trials will be performed.</li><li>
    A formal arrangement will be negotiated and signed.</li><li>
    Cross-certificates will be exchanged between the requesting CA and the
    CFPB.</li></ul><p>Please contact
  the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20008&amp;section=text#cha6">Security and Identity Management Division</a> of CIOB
  at the coordinates indicated in the "Enquiries" section of this Guideline for
  more detailed information on the cross-certification process or to identify a
requirement for cross-certification.</p></section><section anchor="3.3" title="3.3&#xA;Recognition of a CA"><h4>3.3.1 Applicability</h4><p>Recognition of a CA relates to the formal requirements to
satisfy the need for a secure electronic signature as identified within Part 2
of PIPEDA.  Pursuant to the SES Regulations, the President of the Treasury
Board has the authority to recognize an entity or person as a CA.  In
accordance with the SES Regulations, prior to recognizing a CA, the President
of the Treasury Board must be satisfied that the person or entity has the
capacity to issue digital signature certificates in a secure and reliable
manner, as set out by paragraphs 48(2)(a) to (d) of PIPEDA.  Specifically,
these provisions require that: </p><ul><li>
    the electronic signature resulting from the use by a person of the
    technology or process is unique to the person;</li><li>
    the use of the technology or process by a person to incorporate, attach
    or associate the person's electronic signature to an electronic document is
    under the sole control of the person;</li><li>
    the technology or process can be used to identify the person using the
    technology or process; and</li><li>
    the electronic signature can be linked with an electronic document in
    such a way that it can be used to determine whether the electronic document has
    been changed since the electronic signature was incorporated in, attached to or
    associated with the electronic document. </li></ul><p>The circumstances in which departments will require
  recognition of their CA by the President of the Treasury Board are very
  limited. <strong><em> </em></strong>Prior to initiating a request with TBS for
  recognition of their CA, departments should ascertain their needs with regard
  to a program or transaction. <strong><em>Departments should also consult with their
    departmental legal services unit to determine whether there are impediments to
    proceeding electronically and, if there are not, whether a secure electronic
    signature under PIPEDA and the SES Regulations is required or whether another
form of electronic signature may suffice</em></strong>.</p><p>In general, PIPEDA allows a department that is bound under
its legislation to process signed paper documents, but that wishes to implement
electronic documents in their place, to use secure electronic signatures. 
A secure electronic signature also allows certain evidentiary presumptions
established by the SES Regulations under the CEA.  In order to use secure
electronic signatures and benefit from the associated presumptions, the
department must first have its legislation added to the list in Schedule 2 or 3
of PIPEDAand must then comply with the SES Regulations which includes having
the President of the Treasury Board recognize the CA issuing the signing keys<strong>.</strong>  The
regulations specify that CAs recognized as being capable of creating secure
electronic signatures are to be listed on the TBS website.  At this time,
only federal government CAs that have cross-certified with the Canadian Federal
PKI Bridge are eligible to be recognized.</p><p>Where a department has opted into the PIPEDA scheme
described above, secure electronic signatures will have to be used for
electronic documents where:</p><ul><li>
    A certificate or other document signed by a minister or public officer
    serves as proof or evidence – PIPEDA, sect. 36; </li><li>
    A person's seal is required – PIPEDA, sect. 39;</li><li>
    An original document is required – PIPEDA, sect. 42;</li><li>
    A statement under oath is required – PIPEDA, sect. 44;</li><li>
    A statement declaring or certifying that any information given by a
    person making the statement is true, accurate or complete is required  –
    PIPEDA, sect. 45;</li><li>
    A witnessed signature is required – PIPEDA sect. 46.</li></ul><h4>3.3.2 Overview of the Recognition Process</h4><p>The following
high-level steps are performed in order to recognize a CA in the context of the
SES Regulations:</p><ul><li>    Identify the business requirement for recognition;</li><li>    If not already done, the requesting CA will need to cross-certify with
    the CFPB (see section 3.2);</li><li>    The GC CIO will approve the recognition request of the CA once satisfied
    that the CA has the capacity to issue digital signature certificates in a
    secure and reliable manner (within the context of the SES Regulations &amp;
    PIPEDA);</li><li>
    Once approved, the CA's details will be listed on the TBS <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/sim-gsi/sesrca-sesac/sesr-sesa-eng.asp">website</a>.</li><li>
    On an annual basis the recognition status will be reviewed. In order for
    renewal of the CA's recognition status to occur, the CA will need to remain in
    good standing with the CFPB (with regard to cross-certification) and the
    operational authority for the CA will need  to send a letter to CIOB
    indicating that the CA remains in compliance with its certificate policies. </li></ul><p>Please contact the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20008&amp;section=text#cha6">Security and Identity Management Division</a> of CIOB at the coordinates indicated in the "Enquiries" section of this Guideline for details on having a CA recognized.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Operational Guidance"><p>Departments or program managers choosing to use public key
technology as a means of protecting the confidentiality of information or
electronically authenticating the identity of individuals and/or documents should:</p><section anchor="4.1" title="4.1 Align with applicable GC policies, legislation and Orders in Council, by:"><ul><li>
    Using the ICM Common Services CA provided by PWGSC for the purpose of
    issuing medium assurance  digital certificates to users or obtaining the
    appropriate exemptions in order to establish their own departmental certificate
    authority;  </li><li>
    Using the CFPB operated by CSEC when cross-certification is required
    between common and Departmental CAs, or for cross-certification with CAs
    outside the GC; and</li><li>
    Ensuring the use and management of PKI is aligned with GC goals for
    security and identity management as established by the Treasury Board through
    the PGS and its supporting instruments. </li></ul></section><section anchor="4.2" title="4.2 Develop and Maintain Certificate Policies and Certification Practice&#xA;Statements by:"><ul><li>
    Ensuring the CA manages the PKC and certificate revocation lists (CRLs)
    it issues by implementing one or more certificate policies and a certification practice
    statement with respect to the operation of that Certification Authority;</li><li>
    Ensuring compliance with certificate policies and certification practice
    statements by any individual or entity acting on its behalf; and</li><li>
    Where practicable and appropriate, aligning certificate policies and
    certification practice statements with those in use by the CFPB.</li></ul></section><section anchor="4.3" title="4.3 Document and Communicate to Users and relying parties any Rights,&#xA;Requirements, Conditions and Limitations, by:"><ul><li>
    Ensuring users are advised of their respective rights and obligations as
    well as those of the CA;</li><li>
    Developing, implementing, and communicating to users the terms and
    conditions for the appropriate use of and reliance on their PKC and obtaining
    their signed agreement to these terms and conditions;</li><li>
    Developing, implementing, and communicating to users, the policies and
    procedures concerning the use of their PKC; and </li><li>
    Establishing and communicating, or causing to be communicated, to
    relevant parties, including users and relying parties, any limits for any
    judgement, award or settlement made against it by reason of the use of such
    PKC.</li></ul></section><section anchor="4.4" title="4.4&#xA;Ensure Repositories are Up-to-Date and Interoperable, by: "><ul><li>
    Ensuring that PKC and CRLs are published in a repository that is
    appropriately accessible for the purposes of verifying the validity of the
    lists;</li><li>
    Ensuring that any information concerning the CAs PKC and CRLs in the
    repository is current and accurate; and</li><li>
    For a common CA, ensuring that their repository is interoperable with
    other departmental and common CA repositories and that it is registered with
    the Registrar of Repositories.</li></ul></section><section anchor="4.5" title="4.5 Implement Appropriate Information and Key Management Practices, by:"><ul><li>
    Developing policies and procedures to manage information appropriately
    where encryption is in use.  This information should be managed in
    accordance with the Privacy Act, the Access to Information Act, the Library and
    Archives of Canada Act and other relevant government legislation and
    policies.  In particular, consideration should be given to how the
    department will ensure access to encrypted information in the event of Access
    to Information or eDiscovery requests;</li><li>
    Where applicable, retaining a copy of users' private confidentiality
    keys for data recovery purposes; notifying users that their private
    confidentiality keys are backed up; and, notifying users when the department
    accesses their private confidentiality keys;</li><li>
    Ensuring that they obtain the consent of users before the backup of
    their private confidentiality keys;</li><li>
    Ensuring that the private confidentiality keys of users are not accessed
    or disclosed except with the prior consent of users, or where required or
    authorized by law or with judicial authorization;</li><li>
    Ensuring that they do not retain or have retained, under any
    circumstances, a copy of private digital signature keys. (Note: storage of
