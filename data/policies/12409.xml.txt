This management regime consists of sound management <strong>practices,</strong> strong public service <strong>values</strong>, and clear
    <strong>rules</strong> set out in legislation and Treasury Board policies.</p><p>Consistent with the Expenditure Management System renewal, managers are expected to design and manage their programs in a way that achieves results for Canadians. The intended results should be clear and measurable; performance should be tracked and evaluated and reliable performance information should be factored into all expenditure management planning, decision-making and reporting.</p><p>Modern public sector management <strong>practices</strong> are set out in the <a href="/maf-crg/documents/booklet-livret/booklet-livret-eng.asp">Management Accountability Framework (MAF)</a>, which establishes general expectations of deputy heads. The MAF describes the general and interdependent management practices, such as accountability, stewardship, values, and performance that every organization needs in order to create a productive and innovative working 
    environment. The MAF also serves as a tool for both departments and Treasury Board to assess management performance.</p><p>The MAF emphasizes strong <strong>values</strong> as being fundamental to guiding sound management decisions. The <em><a href="/pubs_pol/hrpubs/tb_851/vec-cve-eng.asp">Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service</a></em> states "how ends are achieved should be as important as the achievements themselves". The manner in which results are achieved is an important reflection of the democratic, ethical, professional, and people values described in the Code. Canadians will look 
    to both the results achieved and the means used to assess their trust in the competence and integrity of the government.</p><p>Beyond the general expectations of MAF and the requirements of the Code, certain management functions must be conducted according to specific <strong>rules</strong> that are set out in legislation and policies. As appropriate, the <a href="/tbs-sct/abu-ans/tb-ct/abu-ans-eng.asp">Treasury Board</a> issues policy instruments pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a></em> and more than
    <a href="/tbs-sct/abu-ans/tbs-sct/abu-ans-eng.asp">20 other pieces of enabling legislation</a> that provide it with the authority to establish pay rates and benefits for government employees, control and report on public expenditures, and establish rules for managing people and public resources.</p></div><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr class="active"><th scope="col"><p><strong>Overview of the Management Accountability Framework</strong></p><p><strong>A comprehensive and integrated model for management and management improvement</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="text-center"><strong>Priority Elements</strong></th></tr><tr><td>MAF Vision: the integrated set of 10 management expectations of deputy ministers</td><td class="text-center"><strong>*</strong></td></tr><tr><td>MAF Assessment: oversight of the state of management</td><td class="text-center"><strong>*</strong></td></tr></table><div> </div><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tbody><tr class="active"><th id="t2_h1"><strong>Knowledge Elements</strong></th><th id="t2_h2" class="text-center"><strong>Priority Elements</strong></th></tr><tr><th id="t2_hA" class="btn-info" colspan="2"><strong>A Values and Ethics</strong></th></tr><tr><th id="t2_hA1" headers="t2_hA t2_h1"><strong>A1 Legal and Ethical Underpinnings</strong></th><td class="text-center" headers="t2_hA1 t2_h2"><strong>*</strong></td></tr><tr><th id="t2_hA1_1" headers="t2_hA t2_hA1 t2_h1"><div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
