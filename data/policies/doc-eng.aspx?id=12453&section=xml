Context"><p>3.1 The Government of Canada recognizes the right of access by the public to information in records under the control of government institutions as an essential element of our system of democracy. The government is committed to openness and transparency by respecting both the spirit and requirements of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, its Regulations and its related policy instruments. </p><p>3.2 The Courts have recognized the quasi-constitutional status of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>. This is because of the role it plays in:</p><ul><li>Facilitating democracy by providing access to records containing the information required to participate in the democratic process; and </li><li>Ensuring that public office holders and public servants are accountable. </li></ul><p>The Government of Canada further acknowledges the importance of facilitating access to records by requiring government institutions to make every reasonable effort to assist applicants. The government must ensure a high standard of care for records under its control. Sound information management plays a key role in facilitating the ability to exercise the right of access under the Act.</p><p>3.3 With the enactment of the <em>Federal Accountability Act</em>, the scope of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> was broadened and now includes well over 200 government institutions. Under the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the Treasury Board President is the designated minister responsible for preparing policy instruments concerning the operation of the Act and its Regulations. The Act establishes that policy and guidelines are the appropriate vehicles for supporting the administration 
of the Act. </p><p>3.4 Heads of government institutions are responsible for the effective, well-coordinated and proactive management of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Access to Information Regulations</em> within their institutions. </p><p>3.5 This policy is issued pursuant to paragraph 70(1)(c) of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.
