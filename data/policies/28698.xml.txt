Response to the grievor</a></li></ul><h3 id="AppB1">1. General information</h3><h4 id="AppB1-1">1.1 Who may file a classification grievance</h4><p>1.1.1 The <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.3/"><em>Public Service Labour Relations Act</em></a> determines who has the right to grieve<em>. </em>This right is provided, but not  limited, to those employed in the core public administration in a managerial or  confidential capacity, and it excludes, among others: </p><ul><li>Persons  employed on a casual basis;</li><li>Persons  employed on a term basis for a period of less than three months; and</li><li>Persons  required to work less than one third of the normal period for persons doing  similar work. </li></ul><h4 id="AppB1-2">1.2 Presenting a classification grievance</h4><p>1.2.1 A  classification grievance must be presented at the final level of the  departmental grievance process and in accordance with the requirements of the <em>Public Service Labour Relations Act.</em></p><h4 id="AppB1-3">1.3 Circumstances justifying the presentation of a  classification grievance and time limits</h4><p>1.3.1 A classification grievance must be presented by an employee no later than 35  calendar days after the day on which the employee receives notification or,  when the employee has not received such notification, no later than 35 calendar  days after the day on which he or she first becomes aware of an action or  circumstance affecting the classification of the position he or she occupies.</p><p>1.3.2 Employees  must present their grievance in writing to their immediate supervisor or local  officer-in-charge, as defined by the organization, using the <a href="/tbsf-fsct/340-55-eng.asp">grievance  form</a> provided by the employer. The written grievance must include the substance of  the grievance; the title, position number and classification of the position  being grieved; the corrective action being requested; and the name of the  grievor's representative. The grievance form must be signed and dated by the  grievor.</p><h4 id="AppB1-4">1.4 Choice of representation</h4><p>1.4.1 Representation of a grievor who is included  in a bargaining unit must be in accordance with the <em>Public Service Labour Relations Act</em>. If the grievor occupies an  unrepresented position or a confidential or managerial position, the grievor  may be represented by any person of his or her choice, provided there is no  conflict of interest. </p><h4 id="AppB1-5">1.5 Acknowledging receipt of the grievance</h4><p>1.5.1 On receipt of a classification grievance,  the immediate supervisor or the local officer-in-charge must sign and date the  grievance form.</p><p>1.5.2 The immediate supervisor or the local  officer-in-charge must return the signed and dated copy of the grievance form  to the grievor and transmit the grievance to the deputy head or delegate for  classification grievances.</p><h4 id="AppB1-6">1.6 Time limit for responding to a grievance</h4><p>1.6.1 Under subsection 72(2) of the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-79/index.html#docCont"><em>Public Service Labour Relations Regulations</em></a>, the deadline for  providing a written response to the grievor is no later than 80 calendar days  after the day on which the immediate supervisor or the local officer-in-charge  receives the grievance.</p><p>1.6.2 The organization and the grievor or the  grievor's representative (as applicable) may agree to extend the deadline  beyond the 80 calendar days' time limit. However, all extensions of time must  be for a specified period. Extensions for an indefinite period are not  permitted. </p><h4 id="AppB1-7">1.7 Re-examination of a classification decision</h4><p>1.7.1 When an organization decides to re-examine a  classification decision for a position against which a classification grievance  has been presented, the classification grievance should be held in abeyance  pending the outcome of the re-examination. </p><p>1.7.2 Once the re-examination process is  concluded, the organization will formally inform the grievor of the results of  the re-examination (confirmation of the existing classification decision or  issuance of a new decision).</p><p>1.7.3 In either case, if the grievor wishes to  continue with his or her initial classification grievance, the grievance  process must proceed in accordance with the procedure outlined in this  appendix.</p><h4 id="AppB1-8">1.8 Withdrawal of a grievance by the employee</h4><p>1.8.1 At any time before the grievance decision  is issued, a grievor may withdraw a grievance by giving signed written notice  to the immediate supervisor or the local officer-in-charge. </p><p>1.8.2 The immediate supervisor or local  officer-in-charge must forward the notice of withdrawal directly to the  responsible human resources advisor, who will notify the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO) in  accordance with the departmental process. </p><p>1.8.3 Only the employee may withdraw his or her  classification grievance. No person, including the employee's representative,  may do so on behalf of the employee.</p><h3 id="AppB2">2. Initial examination of a  classification grievance</h3><p>2.1 All grievances must be examined upon  receipt. When a classification grievance is rejected, the deputy head or  delegate will issue the decision and respond to the grievor accordingly. </p><p>2.2 When grievances relating to both the  content of the job description and the classification of the position occupied  by the grievor are presented, the classification grievance, if timely, should  be held in abeyance until the related labour relations grievance process is  complete. <br />
  If, as a result of the labour relations grievance  process:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>The  content of the job description changes, then a new classification decision must  be issued by the organization, based on an evaluation of the new job  description. The organization must notify the grievor of the new classification  decision as required by this directive; or </li><li>The  content of the job description remains the same, then the existing  classification decision remains in effect and a new classification decision  does not need to be issued. </li></ol><p>In either scenario, the organization must  confirm with the grievor whether he or she intends to pursue the original  classification grievance against the most recent classification decision. If  the grievor wishes to continue with the classification grievance, the grievance  process must proceed in accordance with the procedure outlined in this  appendix. </p><p>2.3 When grievances relating to both the  classification and the effective date of the position occupied by the grievor  are presented, the classification grievance process and the labour relations  grievance process may proceed concurrently. For the classification grievance  process, the effective date of the grieved classification decision will remain  in effect unless a change in the effective date results from the labour  relations grievance process.</p><h3 id="AppB3">3. Classification Grievance  Committee</h3><h4 id="AppB3-1">3.1 Mandate</h4><p>The Classification Grievance Committee is  responsible for establishing the  appropriate classification of the grieved position based on the work assigned  by the responsible manager and described in the job description, and the  additional information provided by management and the grievor or the grievor's  representative. The classification that is recommended to the deputy head or  delegate must be equitable and consistent with the Treasury Board  classification policy instruments, including the relevant job evaluation  standard.</p><h4 id="AppB3-2">3.2 Scheduling</h4><p>3.2.1 Upon receiving a grievance,  the departmental lead will contact OCHRO to establish a hearing date. </p><p>3.2.2 Once the date has been  established, the organization will formally contact the grievor and the  grievor's representative at least 21 calendar days in advance, to inform them  of the location (normally at the organization's headquarters) and the date and  the time of the hearing. The date chosen may be changed only under exceptional  circumstances and with the approval of OCHRO. </p><p>3.2.3 The employer will not assume  any liability for expenses incurred by a grievor, unless specifically provided  for in a collective agreement. An employee who wishes to be present at the  grievance hearing is responsible for his or her expenses and must make  arrangements for leave from his or her place of work.</p><h4 id="AppB3-3">3.3 Composition of the Classification Grievance Committee</h4><p>3.3.1 A Classification Grievance  Committee has three members; whenever possible, both genders are to be  represented. The members of the committee include the following:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>A  chairperson, who is an accredited classification advisor;</li><li>An  OCHRO grievance officer, except as specified in subsection 3.3.4; and</li><li>An individual from within or outside the  organization—preferably a manager who has knowledge of both the job evaluation  <span class="nowrap">standard(s)</span> being used and of the work being evaluated.</li></ol><p>3.3.2 The committee members must meet the  following criteria:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>They  did not participate in the classification decision of the position being  grieved;</li><li>They  are not supervising the position in question, nor are they in any situation of  real or perceived conflict of interest; </li><li>They  are unrepresented or occupy a managerial or confidential position; and</li><li>They are knowledgeable about job evaluation  techniques and experienced in the use of job evaluation standards.</li></ol><p>3.3.3 An OCHRO grievance officer will chair the  Classification Grievance Committee when the classification decision of the  position being grieved has been authorized by the deputy head. </p><p>3.3.4 The presence of an OCHRO grievance officer  is not required when:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>A  classification grievance is submitted against the same position for which a  classification grievance decision had previously been issued and the new job  description and the organizational context are identical to the submission for  the previous grievance decision; or</li><li>A  classification grievance is submitted against a unique position for which the  risk of a decision having a negative impact on internal and external relativity  is low. This requirement does not apply in the case of a grievance submitted  against an Executive Group position.</li></ol><p>3.3.5 When a classification grievance has been  submitted against the same position for which a previous grievance decision had  been issued, but the new job description is not identical to the one submitted  for the previous grievance decision, the grievance must be presented before a  new Classification Grievance Committee that includes an OCHRO grievance  officer. If the committee is of the view that: </p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>No  significant change has occurred since the previous grievance decision, a  recommendation to support this conclusion will be made to the deputy head or  delegate, who will issue a new final and binding decision, with the effective  date of the previous grievance decision; or</li><li>One  or more significant changes have occurred since the previous grievance  decision, the committee will review the case and make a recommendation to the  deputy head or delegate, who will issue a new final and binding decision, with  the effective date of the new duties. </li></ol><p>3.3.6 Under subsection 3.3.4 (b), organizations  must obtain OCHRO's approval to proceed without an OCHRO grievance officer, and  requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. When approval to proceed  without an OCHRO grievance officer is granted, the chairperson must be an  accredited classification advisor of the host organization and at least one of  the committee members must be an employee from another organization. </p><p>3.3.7 Although the presence of an OCRHO grievance  officer is not required in cases noted in subsection 3.3.4, a Classification  Grievance Committee must be convened, and the grievance procedure outlined in  this appendix must be adhered to. OCHRO must also receive the documentation and  information identified in subsection 3.4, including the complete report and the  letter to the grievor informing him or her of the grievance decision. In all  cases, the grievor and the grievor's representative must be invited to make a  presentation to the committee.</p><h4 id="AppB3-4">3.4 Documentation and information required</h4><p>3.4.1 The following documentation must be sent to  each committee member and to the grievor's representative (or to the grievor if  the grievor is not represented) at least 21 calendar days before the hearing  date:</p><ul><li>Signed  grievance presentation form;</li><li>Notice  of the classification decision for the position being grieved; </li><li>Rationale  for the classification decision of the position being grieved;</li><li>Job  description forming the basis of the classification decision being grieved,  signed by the responsible supervisor and indicating the effective date; </li><li>Organization  chart in effect, signed and dated by the responsible manager; the chart depicts  the organizational location of the grieved position and its relationship to the  other positions in the same unit or division; </li><li>Supervisor's  job description;</li><li>Job  descriptions for any immediate subordinate positions, upon request; </li><li>Job  validation review report, if available;</li><li>Any  other pertinent information that may help resolve the grievance (for example, a  departmental study or precedents); and</li><li>Written  presentation(s) submitted before the hearing.</li></ul><p>3.4.2 For classification grievances concerning  positions where the deputy head has authorized the classification decision, the  documentation specified in subsection 3.4.1 must be sent to OCHRO. </p><p>3.4.3 The following information must also be  provided to OCHRO:</p><ul><li>Date  on which the employee was notified or became aware of the action giving rise to  the grievance;</li><li>Bargaining  unit affiliation of the grievor and whether the grievor occupies an  unrepresented position or a managerial or confidential position; and </li><li>Names  and job titles of the Classification Grievance Committee members.</li></ul><p>3.4.4 When standardized job descriptions are  implemented and multiple grievances are presented against the same  classification decision, organizations must provide OCHRO with a list of the grievances  covering the related decision, but need to submit only one copy of the  applicable job description and other documentation relevant to the decision  being grieved. </p><h4 id="AppB3-5">3.5 Role of the chairperson</h4><p>3.5.1 The chairperson is responsible for ensuring  that the Classification Grievance Committee members and the grievor, in  particular, are reminded of the committee's role and of the grievance  procedure. The grievor and the grievor's representative must be made aware that  all aspects of the classification of the grieved position will be reviewed by  the committee and that the decision will be final and binding and could result  in the upgrading, confirmation or downgrading of the grievor's position. The  chairperson must explain the roles of the committee members and outline the  procedure that the committee will follow:</p><ul><li>The  grievor or the grievor's representative presents arguments;</li><li>Management  responds to questions, if deemed necessary by the Classification Grievance  Committee;</li><li>The  committee deliberates;</li><li>The  chairperson of the committee ensures that a report is prepared and that it  includes a recommendation; and</li><li>The  deputy head or delegate issues the final and binding decision.</li></ul><p>3.5.2 The chairperson must have a clear  understanding of the grievance, including details of the position being grieved  and the organizational context, in order to provide precise, first-hand  explanations and information to the committee members. The chairperson is  responsible for overseeing the conduct of the meeting.</p><h4 id="AppB3-6">3.6 Hearing</h4><p>3.6.1 The classification grievance  process is not intended to be adversarial. It provides an opportunity for the  presentation and provision of information to the Classification Grievance  Committee. </p><p>3.6.2 <strong>Presentation by the grievor and the  grievor's representative</strong></p><p>The grievor and  the grievor's representative must be given the opportunity to make a  presentation, in person (for example, by teleconference) or in writing, to the  Classification Grievance Committee before a recommendation is made regarding  the classification of the grieved position. Once the presentation is completed,  they must withdraw from the meeting. </p><p>3.6.3 <strong>Management information</strong></p><p>A management  representative familiar with the work of the grieved position must be available  to respond to questions the committee members may have about the position.</p><p>The management  representative is not permitted to:</p><ul><li>Argue  in favour of, or against, the existing classification decision; </li><li>Attempt  to influence the committee members; </li><li>Participate  in the committee's deliberations; or </li><li>Be  present when the grievor and the grievor's representative make a presentation  to the committee. </li></ul><p>3.6.4 <strong>Additional information</strong></p><p>The committee may  call upon other persons to provide additional information and to conduct a job  validation review, as necessary. </p><p>Because  classification grievances are heard at the final level of the grievance process  and the decision is final and binding, it is critical that the decision be  based on an accurate job description describing the work assigned by  management. To facilitate the committee's work and avoid delay, it is  encouraged, when a classification grievance is presented, that a job validation  review be conducted with the employee and in consultation with the employee's  manager before the hearing. A copy of the job validation report must be  provided to the grievor and the grievor's representative. </p><p>3.6.5 <strong>Disclosure of new or contradictory information</strong></p><p>When information that the grievor could not reasonably have known is provided  to the committee by a management representative, or others, and the committee  determines that the information is relevant to its deliberations, including  information that contradicts the information provided by the grievor or the  grievor's representative, the committee must disclose the information to the  grievor or the grievor's representative and provide him or her with the  opportunity to respond. </p><h4 id="AppB3-7">3.7 Committee deliberations</h4><p>3.7.1 The  committee deliberations occur <em>in camera</em>.  The members will examine the information presented and discuss and evaluate the  position in question against the appropriate job evaluation standard. Members  will review all aspects of the classification decision being grieved (the group  and sub-group allocation, the job evaluation standard, the level and the  ratings, if applicable), even though in some instances not all aspects are  being challenged. Members will attempt to reach a consensus when evaluating the  position. If a consensus is not reached, minority and majority reports will be  prepared. The possible financial implications of the reclassification of one or  more grieved positions may not be considered by the committee during its deliberations.</p><p>3.7.2 The  committee may recommend that the current classification decision be confirmed,  that there be a change in the evaluation, or that the position be reclassified  to a higher or lower level within the same or a different occupational group. </p><p> 3.7.3 The proceedings in general and the committee's recommendation in  particular may not be disclosed to, discussed with, or influenced by outside  parties. </p><h4 id="AppB3-8">3.8 Classification Grievance Committee report and  recommendation</h4><p>3.8.1 The Classification Grievance  Committee report summarizes the recommendation of the committee, responds to  the arguments and relativity put forward by the grievor and the grievor's  representative, and provides the analysis used by the committee to arrive at  its recommendation. The report must include the following information:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li><strong>Identifying information</strong><p>This section  should provide the grievance case number; the grievor's name; the grieved  position's number, title and classification; the organization's name; and the geographical  location.</p></li><li><strong>Committee members</strong><p>This section  should list the names and organizations of the committee's chairperson and  members.</p></li><li><strong>Date and location of grievance hearing</strong></li><li><strong>Nature of complaint</strong><p>This section  should provide a summary of the classification action or decision giving rise  to the grievance and the specific corrective action requested by the grievor.</p></li><li><strong>Representation by, or on behalf of, the grievor</strong><p>This section should provide the name of the grievor's representative, if  applicable. It should summarize the salient points made in support of the  grievance, including relativity put forward and the rationale for the  classification proposed by the grievor.</p></li><li><strong>Management information</strong><p>This section  should provide the name and title of the management representative and the  representative's hierarchical relationship to the position being grieved. It  should summarize the information provided by this representative, including  responses to the questions asked by the committee. Any submitted documentation  should also be noted. As required by subsection 3.6.5 of this appendix, the  committee must provide the grievor with the right to respond to information  that the grievor could not reasonably have known or that contradicts the  information presented by the grievor or the grievor's representative and that  is relevant to the committee's deliberations.</p></li><li><strong>Committee deliberations</strong><p>This section is  the heart of the report and must clearly indicate how the committee arrived at  its recommendation. It should analyze the work assigned to the grievor in  relation to the job evaluation standard(s), the arguments (in particular, the  proposed ratings, benchmark positions and relativity) made by, or on behalf of,  the grievor and the information presented by management; and should provide an  explanation of the committee's evaluation. It should state why the committee  evaluated the position in the specific occupational group and subgroup and  applied a specific standard; how it arrived at a specific level; and what, if  any, other occupational groups and job evaluation standards were considered,  and the reasons why they were considered inappropriate. For ratings that have  not been contested and for which, after review, the committee concurs with the  existing departmental evaluation, the report does not need to include a  justification if the departmental rationale is part of the grievance case  documentation.</p></li><li><strong>Committee recommendation</strong><p>This section  should state the committee's recommendation regarding the occupational group,  the relevant standard and the level of the position. It should also indicate  the authorized effective date.</p></li><li><strong>Signatures</strong><p>All committee  members and the deputy head or delegate must sign and date the report.</p></li></ol><p>3.8.2 A Classification Grievance  Committee report is not complete and must not be submitted to the deputy head  or delegate for approval until it has been signed by all committee members.

Classification grievance  decision</h3><h4 id="AppB4-1">4.1 Decision by the deputy head or delegate</h4><p>4.1.1 On reviewing the  Classification Grievance Committee report and recommendation, the deputy head or delegate may:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>Approve the  committee's recommendation if the report is unanimous;</li><li>Reject the committee's recommendation(s). If the delegate rejects the unanimous recommendation or the minority and  majority recommendations of the committee, the decision must be personally  approved by the deputy head. In such circumstances, the  deputy head must report to OCHRO, and include in his or her response to the  grievor, the reasons for non-acceptance, tied directly to the justification  used by the committee in arriving at its recommendation; or</li><li>Approve the recommendation provided in either a  majority report or in a minority report. If the recommendation of a minority  report is accepted by the delegate, the delegate must notify the deputy head  before issuing a decision.</li></ol><h4 id="AppB4-2">4.2 Status of a grievance decision</h4><p>4.2.1 The  decision resulting from the classification grievance is final and binding. </p><p>4.2.2 Unless a significant change  occurs that is likely to affect the evaluation or the nature of the position, a  classification review must maintain the group, sub-group (if applicable), level  or ratings of the classification grievance decision.</p><p>4.2.3 A final and binding decision  does not preclude an employee from submitting a new grievance following  notification of the review of the employee's position when <em>no significant change</em> was recognized. In such cases, the grievance  must be accepted and treated in accordance with this procedure.</p><p>4.2.4 Each case  must be dealt with on its own merits.</p><h3 id="AppB5">5.
