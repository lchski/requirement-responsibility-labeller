  are not entitled to free public education at adequate educational facilities; or</li><li>as a result of the employee's posting to a location in Canada, adequate public education is not available 
  in the official language of the employee's children;

  that the employee's children could attend at no cost; or</li><li>expenses to send the employee's children to adequate educational facilities are not paid by the appropriate 
  municipal, provincial or territorial agencies or through another policy.</li></ol></li><li>The maximum reimbursement, per academic year per child, is the lesser of $5,500 or the amount of admissible

proof of payment.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Application"><p>This policy applies to all employees within that portion of the Public Service specified in Part I, Schedule I 
of the <em>Public Service Staff Relations Act</em> and to members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p><p>This policy does not apply to employees posted abroad. Part V of the Foreign Service Directives applies 
in those cases.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Policy requirements"><p><strong>Note:</strong> The definitions in Appendix A apply throughout this policy.</p><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 School fees"><p>When the adequate educational facility requires that non-resident school fees be paid for the child's education, 
the deputy head must not reimburse an amount that is higher than the school authority ordinarily charges for a non-resident 
student.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Transportation"><p>The deputy head may, under the following circumstances, assist with the cost of daily transportation to 
and from an educational facility: the school authority does not provide adequate transportation and the educational facility 
is located more than eight kilometres from the child's residence, and the cost exceeds $3 per month per child or $5 per month 
for two or more children of the same family. The forms of assistance are:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>reimbursement of the cost that exceeds the limits stated above for using public, non-urban transportation;</li><li>providing a chartered or Crown-owned vehicle or taxi for transportation. The employee must contribute 
  to the cost of this transportation, up to the limits stated above. This charge will be suspended if the child is absent 
  from school two weeks or more for a recognized cause; or</li><li>where none of the above means of transportation are available, employees may, upon request and with 
  the deputy head's approval, receive a kilometric allowance each day they transport their children to and from the adequate 
  educational facility. The allowance is equal to the return distance between the employee's home and the educational facility 
  times the traveller-requested rates as provided by the Travel Directive.</li></ol></section><section anchor="5.3" title="5.3 Board and lodging"><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The deputy head reimburses costs for board and lodging only where:
  <ol class="lower-roman"><li>no suitable daily transportation is available;</li><li>the cost is less than that of daily transportation; or</li><li>daily transportation is not feasible because of time, distance or terrain.</li></ol></li><li>Before authorizing reimbursement for meals, the deputy head should consider the normal food costs the 
  employee incurs when the child lives at home.</li></ol></section><section anchor="5.4" title="5.4 Travel expenses"><p>Where a deputy head has authorized a child's board and lodging away from the employee's place of residence, 
the employee is entitled to reimbursement of eligible travel expenses when the child returns to the employee's place of 
duty during a school holiday. Eligible expenses are actual and reasonable transportation and travelling expenses the child 
incurs for two return trips each school year, between the employee's place of duty and adequate educational facility. If 
the employee has elected to send the child to a different school, the deputy head must reimburse only the amount that would 
be eligible if the child were attending the adequate educational facility.</p></section><section anchor="5.5" title="5.5 Tutoring fees"><h4>5.5.1 Subjects</h4><p>Deputy heads may reimburse expenses for tutoring fees:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>in subjects where the child's educational level is below that of the new educational facility and 
  where the school authority feels the deficiency is directly attributable to the circumstances of the parent's previous 
  location(s) of employment;</li><li>for subjects the previous educational facility attended by the child does not normally offer but 
  the educational facility in question does;</li><li>for subjects the province or territory of residence normally offers but the educational facility 
  that the child must attend in question does not.</li></ol><h4>5.5.2 Official Languages</h4><p>Where adequate educational facilities are available but the curriculum is offered only in the child's second 
official language, and the employee elects to send the child to that educational facility, the deputy head may, in certain 
cases, reimburse the cost of extracurricular courses or tutors to instruct the child in the educational facility's official 
language of instruction. The employee must however show evidence that the local school authorities at the employee's place 
of residence have interviewed the child either before or after the transfer and concur that the child would avoid losing 
academic standing if the courses or tutors were provided.</p></section><section anchor="5.6" title="5.6 Other costs"><p>The deputy head may authorize the payment of fees, expenses and charges for courses, instructions, services, 
programs, books and materials normally provided, without additional cost to the family, as part of the educational program 
of the province or territory of residence but not provided at the approved adequate educational facility the child attends.</p></section><section anchor="5.7" title="5.7 Payment of costs in the Yukon Territories"><p>In accordance with Order in Council 1962-17/1371, deputy heads with employees residing in the Yukon Territory 
must pay the Government of the Yukon Territory $350 per school year for each child who attends an educational facility operated 
by the Government of the Yukon Territory and is a dependant of a federal government employee occupying non-taxable quarters. 
The payment should be applied to the operation and maintenance of the educational facility.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Monitoring"><p>Deputy heads shall keep records of all educational assistance they provide to employees with school-aged
