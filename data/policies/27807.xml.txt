      when Treasury Board approval is required for either project approval (<abbr title="project approval">PA</abbr>) or
      expenditure authority (<abbr title="expenditure authority">EA</abbr>), including amendments to a <abbr title="project approval">PA</abbr> or an <abbr title="expenditure authority">EA</abbr> decision, a project
      brief must be appended to the Treasury Board submission.<a href="#fn1" id="fnr1" title="View Footnote [1]">[1]</a> For guidance on <abbr title="project approval">PA</abbr> or <abbr title="expenditure authority">EA</abbr> and the Treasury Board submission process, please refer to the <em><a href="/tbs-pct/index-eng.asp">2014 Guidance for the Preparation of <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Submissions</a></em>.</p><p>A project brief ensures that Treasury Board ministers or
      the department's approval authority have a thorough understanding of the
      proposed initiative by providing additional detail and/or context not in the Treasury
      Board submission. The project brief is an iterative document that progressively
      reflects the state of the project with each update and shows the relationship
      between the project, government priorities, departmental priorities, and
      long-term strategic planning objectives and outcomes.</p><p>In accordance with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy on the Management of Projects</a></em>,
      a project brief is to be supported by a business case, project charter and project
      management plan. The project brief contains a synopsis of the key components of
      these core project documents and provides a concise but complete description of
      the scope of the project, permitting the Treasury Board submission to be as
      succinct as possible.</p><p>Departments are encouraged to update their core project
      documents, and subsequently their project brief, at regular and meaningful
      intervals throughout the life-cycle of the project<a href="#fn2" id="fnr2" title="View Footnote [2]">[2]</a>.
      Although these intervals could coincide with Treasury Board decisions, the
      timing of Treasury Board submissions should not be the determining factor for
      ensuring that current information is available to decision makers. Each time
      the project brief is submitted to the Treasury Board, reconciliation with the previous
      Treasury Board decision should be apparent in the project brief. </p><p>Appendix B of the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy on the Management of Projects</a></em> lists the required content of a project brief. The Guide to a Project Brief has
      been designed to provide guidance on the level and type of information required
      in a project brief by the policy. The Guide aligns with those requirements and
      includes additional guidance in the form of headings, examples and descriptions.
      The structure of the Guide to a Project Brief follows that of Appendix B and is
      intended to ensure the completeness of the required content. Excerpts from
      Appendix B are included throughout the Guide.</p><p>It is important to note that the Guide is provided as
      guidance and that the content of the project brief may be tailored to better
      reflect a particular project. Departments are encouraged to consult with the
      Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat about the content of their project briefs.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="1. Project Description"><p>This section provides a brief high-level
        summary of the important details of the project.  </p><blockquote><p><em>4.2 The level of service or capability to be developed,
          accessed or improved and a general description of the good or service and the
          program outcomes to be achieved.</em></p></blockquote><section anchor="2.1" title="1.1 Project Background"><p>This section presents a high-level description of the project’s
          history, a summary of any relevant Cabinet or Treasury Board decisions, any project
          approval (<abbr title="project approval">PA</abbr>) and expenditure authority (<abbr title="expenditure authority">EA</abbr>) decisions or conditions, including
          the Treasury Board Number and the appropriate date, and the general context of the
          initiative’s progress in terms of any Cabinet decisions or other key decision
          points.  </p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="1.2 Description of Service or Capability"><p>It is critical to position the proposed project or
          project phase in the context of the identified program requirement and the full
          investment proposal.</p><p>This section provides a description of the service or
          capability that the project intends to develop, create or improve, as well as
          the benefits that are to be derived and how that service or capability will be
          managed once the solution is in place at project closeout. In the context of
          the definition of a project, in accordance with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy on the Management of Projects</a></em>, the service or capability is the defined output that
          the project is required to produce.</p></section><section anchor="2.3" title="1.3 Project Scope"><p>Project scope can be defined as the work that needs to be
          accomplished to deliver a product, service or result with the specified
          features and functions.<a href="#fn3" id="fnr3" title="View Footnote [3]">[3]</a> This section describes the project scope in terms of a scope statement. Depending
          on the maturity of the project, this can be either the preliminary scope
          statement at the early stages of a project’s life-cycle or a more detailed
          scope statement that is the basis for future project decisions. The scope
          statement should be fully articulated and detailed in a project document. This
          document should be the source document for the content of this section and
          appropriately referenced.</p><p>The scope statement should address a number of key factors
          (refer to the <abbr title="roject Management Body of Knowledge">PMBOK</abbr><sup>®</sup> Guide), the
          key activities and outputs, and any significant performance criteria. The
          presentation of scope is to align with the key deliverables and planned phases
          of the project. </p><p>In addition, this section should include a description of
          how the scope was developed, including the requirements determination, a scope
          definition in response to the defined requirements, and a summary of the key
          deliverables from the work breakdown structure.</p><p>A table may be used to present what is in and out of
          scope for the project. The table below provides an example output and a
          succinct description of the scope.</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="widthFull"><thead><tr class="lightgreyBG"><th scope="col" class="alignCenter"><strong>Project Output</strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignCenter"><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Financial Reporting Form</p></td><td><p>A common form and guide to annually

          either a total indicative cost estimate or substantive estimate for the entire
          project. Project cost estimates for <abbr title="project approval">PA</abbr> are likely to be at an indicative level,
          and include all activities and project deliverables from the project definition
          phase through to project closeout. In accordance with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy on the Management of Projects</a></em>, and <em><a href="/tbs-pct/index-eng.asp">2014 Guidance for the Preparation of <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Submissions</a></em>,
          the cost estimate for <abbr title="expenditure authority">EA</abbr> is to be substantive in nature and can only be sought
          for phases of the project that have been appropriately defined and assessed
          using the Project Complexity and Risk Assessment (<abbr title="Project Complexity and Risk Assessment">PCRA</abbr>) Tool.</p><h4>Sources of Funds</h4><p>In this section, the sources of funds are identified and all
          assumptions and constraints related to funding are clearly described.</p><h4>Project Cost Estimates</h4><p>The Secretariat’s <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12251&amp;section=text">Guide to Costing</a></em> has been
          developed to advance stewardship, accountability, and value for money across
          the Government of Canada. Departments are encouraged to prepare the cost
          estimates for all Treasury Board submissions using the <em>Guide to Costing</em>,
          and to present the cost estimates for all Treasury Board submissions using the <em><a href="/tbs-pct/index-eng.asp">Guide to Preparing <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Submissions</a></em>.</p><p>The following are considerations for inclusion in
          articulating the project cost estimates in a project brief.</p><ul><li>Estimated project costs are provided at a level of detail that
            provides assurance that detailed costing due diligence was performed. This will
            include a description of the costing methodology, references to source
            documents, and a statement on whether the cost estimates presented are
            substantive or indicative in nature.</li><li>Costing is detailed, at a minimum, by project phase (e.g.,
            definition, implementation, closeout), as well as by fiscal year if the project
            spans fiscal years. To fully substantiate the cost estimate provided, costing
            is to be further detailed by each defined work package or project stage and
            tied to a discrete project deliverable (output). For those phases of the
            project for which the organization is seeking <abbr title="expenditure authority">EA</abbr>, the sponsoring department must
            clearly demonstrate that the estimates supporting this request are substantive
            in nature. </li><li>For projects spanning more than a single fiscal year, project
            costs are to be presented in both current and constant dollars. The annual
            escalator and its source and appropriateness to the project must be clearly
            articulated. </li><li>Salary costs are included to reflect the organization’s practice for
            attributing salary costs to projects. A brief description of the practice and
            these estimated costs are clearly highlighted. The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?section=text&amp;id=12251">Guide to Costing</a></em> provides more
            information.</li><li>Costing, which covers the full life-cycle of the recommended investment
            option, is also presented. The TBS <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14671&amp;section=text">Guide to Management of Materiel</a></em> defines the phases of life-cycle management
            as: assessing requirements; analyzing options; planning acquisition; acquiring;
            operating, using, and maintaining; and disposing and replacing. This
            cost estimate is to be prepared in accordance with departmental standards and
            processes for developing a total investment life-cycle cost estimate. The
            investment life-cycle will include the project life-cycle (i.e., activities
            required to produce the project output) and the operations, use and maintenance
            costs covering the useful life of the proposed project output. This information
            is to reflect the detailed options analysis considered in the business case,
            which is to be referenced.</li><li>Costing information is to include a list of assumptions and
            exclusions, and risk and contingency broken down as appropriate by deliverable,
            phase and work package.</li><li>For projects involving more than one department, costing tables
            are to be developed to provide a full project costing estimate, including costs
            incurred by all contributing partners, including non-federal partners.</li><li>The reference documents and methodology used to derive the
            project cost estimates are described.
            <ul><li>For
                example: “The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12251&amp;section=text">Guide to Costing</a></em> was used
                to develop all cost estimates presented, in close collaboration with the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officer">CFO</abbr>. Further
                details on the cost estimate are available in the <em>Project A</em> cost
                estimation document, approved on January DD, YYYY. These estimates were based
                on <em>Project B</em>, which was closed out on December DD, YYYY. A workshop with
                all key stakeholders was held, and the findings were documented in the cost
                estimation document. A quantity surveyor and professional costing firm were then
                engaged, and the relevant costing documents are referenced.”</li></ul></li><li>A table may also be useful in presenting the cost estimates.</li></ul></section><section anchor="2.5" title="1.5 &#xA;    Project Schedule"><p>A high-level project schedule summarized for Treasury
          Board ministers is presented in this section. The schedule reflects a
          documented and authoritative project schedule and baseline and includes: </p><ul><li>Milestones and key project outputs (i.e.,
            deliverables);</li><li>Checkpoints within the project governance hierarchy, including
            the department and  the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (the Secretariat); </li><li>Details on implementation planning; and,</li><li>Project gates at which consideration by Treasury Board ministers will
            be relevant.</li></ul><p>A project
          gate is a key decision and control point that occurs before the next major
          milestone or project deliverable or a new project phase (e.g., implementation)
          begins. The gate represents a logical point at which executive
          "gatekeepers" can determine whether and how to proceed. Project gates
          effectively "open" or "close" the path leading to a
          subsequent project phase. The project gate schedule is developed to fit the needs
          of the project and to identify to the Treasury Board at which gates the project
          will seek <abbr title="expenditure authority">EA</abbr>.   </p><blockquote><p><em>4.7.1 The estimated schedule from project
            inception to completion of the project. At a minimum, Treasury Board approval

            business justification and implementation strategy in advance of
            implementation.</em></p></blockquote></section><section anchor="2.6" title="1.6 &#xA;    Assumptions"><p>This section describes all assumptions relevant to the
          project, explains the possible impacts and considerations of these assumptions,
          and outlines any strategies for addressing assumptions that do not materialize.</p></section><section anchor="2.7" title="1.7 &#xA;    Constraints"><p>All specific constraints or restrictions that limit or
          place conditions on the project are described in this section. The description includes
          dependencies on common service providers and other stakeholders, or a limited
          time frame for developing and implementing the proposed project or project
          phase when applicable. Potential impacts are explained and quantified whenever
          possible, and strategies are described for managing these constraints.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="2. Policy and Program Linkage"><p>This section provides a description of the links between
        the project outcomes and the mandate and programs of the sponsoring department,
        as well as to other government-wide objectives. The department’s Program
        Alignment Architecture (<abbr title="Program Alignment Architecture">PAA</abbr>) usually supports this explanation. (Visit the Secretariat’s
        website for more information on the <abbr title="Program Alignment Architecture">PAA</abbr>.) </p><blockquote><p><em>4.1. The relationship of the project outcomes to
          the sponsoring department's mandate, programs and to government-wide
          objectives.</em></p></blockquote><section anchor="3.1" title="2.1 &#xA;    Project Goals and Business Outcomes"><p>The goals and expected business
          outcomes or benefits of the project are described in this section. </p><p>Project goals are high-level
          statements about what the project is expected to accomplish.<a href="#fn4" id="fnr4" title="View Footnote [4]">[4]</a> Project goals are broad, general intentions and are typically intangible and
          abstract. An example of a project goal is “greater flexibility in responding to
          stakeholder requests.”</p><p>Business
          outcomes can be used to articulate the value of the initiative. In an
          organizational context, an outcome involves an intentional change (people,
          processes, technology) being imposed on the system, with a resulting end state
          that can be measured.<a href="#fn5" id="fnr5" title="View Footnote [5]">[5]</a> Examples of business outcomes are “decreased inspection time” and “increased
          public confidence.”</p><p>It is recommended that departments articulate business
          outcomes over the life-cycle of the project and tie the measurement of
          intermediate outcomes to the proposed gating model for the project so that
          outcome realization is being reviewed at key “go” and “no-go” decision points.</p><p>As the brief is to enable decision makers to fully
          understand the proposed initiative, it is important that the project’s expected
          business outcomes be clearly articulated in commonly understood terms. Decision
          makers must also be informed of the criticality of the proposed project.</p><p>Specifically:      </p><ul><li>What is the business outcome?</li><li>Why is the specific business outcome needed?</li><li>Why is the project to deliver the business outcome needed now?
            (i.e. What are the consequences of not going forward with this proposed
            solution now?)</li><li>Two examples of a description of a project and its
            business outcomes are included as an annex to this guide.</li></ul></section><section anchor="3.2" title="2.2 &#xA;    Mandate"><p>This section briefly describes the mandate of the sponsoring
          department and any partnering departments in a joint project, along with any branches,
          if applicable, and relates the business outcomes to each relevant mandate.</p></section><section anchor="3.3" title="2.3 &#xA;    Alignment with Program"><p>This section describes the program outcomes to be supported
          by the end result of the project and explains how the achievement of project goals
          will enable the intended program outcomes.</p><p>Where possible, the degree of alignment with the
          department’s <abbr title="Program Alignment Architecture">PAA</abbr> and Management Resources and Results Structure (<abbr title="Management Resources and Results Structure">MRRS</abbr>) should
          be articulated.</p></section><section anchor="3.4" title="2.4 &#xA;    Alignment with Government-Wide Priorities"><p>This section, when applicable, describes linkages with
          other public sector programs and projects (e.g., federal, non-federal,
          provincial, municipal, First Nations) and how this project solution supports broader
          government-wide priorities.  </p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="3. Link to the Investment Plan"><p>This section clearly positions the
        project, as part of an investment, within the departmental investment plan.</p><blockquote><p><em> 4.3 The
          significance of the project in the context of the department's investment
          plan. </em></p></blockquote><p>The importance and magnitude of
        the project as part of an investment and how it supports and aligns with other
        investments included in the investment plan are described. The project proposal
        should be consistent with the project information in the investment plan and should
        describe the total estimated life-cycle costs of the entire investment.  This includes
        both the project required to produce the defined outcome or product, and the
        subsequent operations, maintenance and disposal, if applicable, of that outcome
        or product. The plan should clearly confirm the affordability not only of the
        proposed project but also of all ongoing (i.e., life-cycle) costs of the entire
        investment.</p><p>If the project was not in the most recent investment plan
        provided to the Secretariat and/or the Treasury Board, this section includes an
        explanation of what caused the change (e.g., additional funding provided
        through a Cabinet decision or a change in priority) and a brief description of
        the incremental capacity needed to deliver this new, unplanned project.
        Departments should also confirm that departmental operations remain affordable
        and sustainable over the long term. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="4. Performance Management"><p>This section describes the
        project’s performance management and outcome management measures.</p><blockquote><p><em>4.5 The performance and outcome management
          measures, including an evaluation strategy and provision for an independent
          third-party evaluation when required.</em></p></blockquote><section anchor="4.1" title="4.1 Business Outcome Management Strategy"><p>In any performance management framework, it is critical
          to adequately define the expected outcomes at the outset. This section provides
          a description of the strategy for measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing
          the business outcomes described in Section 2 of the project brief. The
          measurement of any intermediate outcomes, in accordance with the proposed
          gating model for the project, is articulated so that outcome realization is
          reviewed at key “go” and “no-go” decision points over the project life-cycle.</p><p>An outcomes register may be used to present the outcomes
          and the associated measures.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="4.2 Project Performance Management Strategy"><p>This section provides a description of the integrated and
          disciplined approach to managing project performance and results. It also
          includes a succinct explanation of how project progress will be monitored and
          tracked in terms of the project performance metrics associated with cost,
          schedule, scope and any other critical objectives.</p><p>In addition, this section includes the strategy outlined
          in the Project Management Plan and aligns the strategy with the project
          schedule (refer to the <em>Guide to Project Evaluation and Close-out Reports<a href="#fn6" id="fnr6" title="View Footnote [6]">[6]</a></em> for more information).</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="4.3 Audit and Evaluation Strategy"><p>This section presents a detailed audit and evaluation
          strategy for the project, including any provisions for independent third-party
          evaluations, reviews or audits as and when required. This section also addresses
          when and at what phases of the project life-cycle monitoring and reporting
          activities are planned. All planned reporting to the project authority (i.e., Treasury
          Board or the sponsoring minister) is included, at a minimum. Relevant reporting
          to the Secretariat and other stakeholders is also described.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="5. Project Options Analysis"><p>In considering any project delivery option, it is
        important for the sponsoring department to recognize that the project life-cycle
        is only a subset of the investment life-cycle. The decision to proceed with a
        particular project solution is expected to consider the full implications of
        that decision over the entirety of the investment. The direct comparison of
        different investment options and the resulting cost-benefit analyses support
        the planned investment and the project proposal. For example, the decision to
        acquire an asset must consider, at a minimum, all applicable costs directly
        attributable to that asset over its entire useful life. </p><p>For instance, an
        acquisition decision that is based on the lowest purchase price but that
        ignores potential operations and maintenance costs may result in higher overall
        costs. Decision making in life-cycle management is an iterative process that
        considers all phases of an asset's life cycle, at key points throughout its
        life cycle. Effective management requires that an appropriate level of
        management interest and control be maintained throughout the investment's life
        cycle.</p><p>Although the project may be affordable on its own, the
        continued affordability of the entire asset portfolio as well as departmental
        operations must be confirmed in accordance with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18225&amp;section=text">Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired
        Services</a></em> before the project can be approved.</p><p>This section summarizes each of the considered viable options,
        including at a minimum the status quo and the recommended option. </p><p>When describing the project options, Treasury Board ministers
        must be assured that the proposed investment is affordable over the entire life-cycle.
        For example, once the project to acquire the use of an asset is approved, the
        government begins to spend resources; once the asset is operational, there can
        be legal obligations and the government is committed financially. The project’s
        business case provides an analysis of investment options to achieve the
        intended business outcomes based on life-cycle cost estimates, likely future
        conditions, relevant risks, impacts, and life-cycle management issues. The
        recommended project option supports the recommended investment option in
        consideration of the cost-benefit of the investment over its entire life-cycle.
        Therefore, when articulating project options, it is important to ensure alignment
        with, and support of, the investment plan and the affordability of the
        investment, not just the project.</p><blockquote><p><em>4.6 The business case reflecting the results of

          the options analysis is to be based, at a minimum, on preliminary life-cycle
          cost estimates for each investment option.</p><p>In considering viable project options that will deliver
          the solution or output needed to achieve the defined outcomes, it is important
          that each project option be considered as part of the total life-cycle of the
          investment. This ensures that the cost-benefit analysis considers the entire
          investment resulting from the project being approved. </p><p>Should the activities and resources required to operate,
          maintain and dispose of the project outcome or solution be precisely the same, irrespective

          to assess planned investments for <abbr title="public-private partnership">PPP</abbr> potential. Planned investments that consider the creation of an
          infrastructure asset with a capital cost of $100 million or more and with a
          useful life of at least 20 years must include a screening of the entire
          investment life-cycle, in consultation with <abbr title="public-private partnership">PPP</abbr> Canada, to determine the
          viability of a <abbr title="public-private partnership">PPP</abbr>. The results of the screening are to be presented in the

          strategy and over fiscal years when the project spans multiple years. For
          example, for large and complex projects, it may be determined that the most
          effective way to ensure that the Treasury Board is appropriately informed is
          through annual status reports and regular updating of the <abbr title="Project Complexity and Risk Assessment">PCRA</abbr> shared with the

          that could affect the project and a description of the risk management plan for
          identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing project risks. Plans for assessing
          initial risk factors and for the ongoing identification, assessment, and
          mitigation of risk factors throughout the project life-cycle are specified.</p><p>The <abbr title="Project Complexity and Risk Assessment">PCRA</abbr> provides the basis for determining the level of
          project risk and complexity and the project approval authority. Its use will
          assist in identifying areas of project risk and complexity warranting further
          assessment and active risk management. In this way, the <abbr title="Project Complexity and Risk Assessment">PCRA</abbr> can be used as a
          tool to mitigate project risk. This section can elaborate on which areas of
          risk or complexity the <abbr title="Project Complexity and Risk Assessment">PCRA</abbr> exposed and what actions the department took or
          plans to take to mitigate project risks. For example, a project affected by
          procurement risks, as identified through a high score in the <abbr title="Project Complexity and Risk Assessment">PCRA</abbr> Procurement
          Knowledge area, may warrant the creation of a Senior Project Advisory Committee

          riders in each direction along the Transitway during peak hours. Currently,
          the transit service is limited to approximately180 buses an hour through
          downtown to meet travel demand. Effectively, the transit system has reached its
          capacity in providing Bus Rapid Transit service through the downtown to serve
          surrounding communities. The system will no longer be able to expand service
          beyond 2018, and is expected to reach capacity shortly afterwards.  Ottawa
          has an expanding population and is Canada’s fourth-largest city and Ontario’s
          second-largest city, with a population of over 900,000 (metropolitan area is
          over 1.2 million) and an area of 2,596 square kilometres. </p><h4>Project Purpose </h4><p>In 2003, the City approved the Transportation Master Plan (TMP)
          for public transit in Ottawa. The Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel (<abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr>)
          project is the centrepiece of the TMP. The purpose of the <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr> project is to
          establish a faster, more efficient, high quality rail-based rapid transit
          service which will accommodate existing and future travel demand into and
          through the downtown.  The <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr> project will help address existing congestion
          and aid in preventing even higher levels of congestion in the future</p><h4>Project Scope and Timing </h4><p>The TMP includes a phased set of projects to be implemented by
          2031. The <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr> project includes a new 12.5 km <abbr title="light rail transit">LRT</abbr> line operating east-west
          through a 3.2 km tunnel beneath downtown Ottawa. The <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr> route will connect
          major development nodes and bus routes, providing the core of a larger light
          rail transit network.</p><p>The <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr> project consists of the following three segments:</p><ul><li>An alignment from the western terminus at Tunney’s Pasture to
            east of Booth Street,</li><li>A 3.2 km tunnel through the downtown core from Booth Street to
            south of</li></ul><p>the University of Ottawa, and</p><ul><li>A route from south of the University of Ottawa to Blair Station.</li></ul><p>Overall, thirteen stations are proposed along the 12.5-km route.
          Four of the stations will be underground and the remaining nine will be
          conversions of the existing Transitway stations to <abbr title="light rail transit">LRT</abbr> stations. The route
          will connect into the existing Transitway east and west of the study area,
          into the Southeast Transitway at Hurdman Station, and to the O-Train at
          Bayview Station.</p><h4>Business Outcomes </h4><p>Building and widening roads alone, especially in downtown
          Ottawa, is not a practical or affordable solution to meet the anticipated
          demands and to support the projected growth on the City’s transportation
          system. By providing greater transportation choice, attracting more riders
          and adding more capacity to the overall transportation network, the <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr>
          project is aiming to help address existing congestion and aid in preventing
          even higher levels of congestion in the future.  The growth of downtown
          employment is expected to continue through the ability to increase capacity
          on transit service in the downtown, primarily on the <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr><abbr title="light rail transit">LRT</abbr> line.</p><p>The final outcomes of <abbr title="Downtown Ottawa Transit Tunnel">DOTT</abbr> are as follows:</p><ul><li> Improve
            mobility, reduce travel times and increase safety and efficiency;</li><li> Expand
            public access and ridership;</li><li> Reduce
            the growth of <abbr title="greenhouse gas">GHG</abbr> and other emissions; and,</li><li> Contribute

          inefficient, and expensive.  The current cost of email services to the 44
          partner organizations is approximately $128.3 <abbr title="medium">M</abbr>.</p><h4>Project Purpose </h4><p>Before <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> became responsible for infrastructure services, the
          operation of multiple email systems across the Government meant that
          departments and agencies negotiated and maintained separate licenses, and had
          their own technical support teams in place.  This duplication was costly and
          unnecessary.  In Budgets 2012 and 2013, the Government announced that <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>
          will realize significant costs savings by creating economies of scale with a
          whole of government approach to <abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr>.  In May 2012, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> launched the Email
          Transformation Initiative (<abbr title="Email Transformation Initiative">ETI</abbr>) project to consolidate the Government’s
          separate email systems to a standardized email service, managed by <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>, and
          delivered to the Partner organizations.  </p><h4>Project Scope and Timing </h4><p>The primary requirements of the <abbr title="Email Transformation Initiative">ETI</abbr> are listed below.</p><ul><li><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will establish a new email service for its <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> Partners and
            itself, in both official languages. The new email service will also be
            available to other departments and agencies, on an optional and cost recovery
            basis.</li><li>The new email service will use a single email domain name.  A
            standard email naming convention will be adopted for all Government of Canada
            (<abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>) employees prescribed in a TBS policy instrument.</li><li>The new email service will be user-friendly and intuitive,
            requiring limited formal training. The new email solution will provide online
            help services and self-training functions to facilitate both the transition
            and ongoing use of the new email solution.</li><li>The new email service will be developed and operated to a single
            government service standard, which will meet at a minimum 99.9% availability
            on a 24 / 7 / 365 basis.</li><li>The new email service will be comprised of two individual email
            systems. The first will be certified to handle emails designated up to and
            including Protected B level, with attachments, when sent or received from
            within the Government network. The second email service will be certified to
            handle email designated as Secret. Secret email will not be deployed until
            the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> has a secure infrastructure available.</li></ul><p>The duration of the project should not exceed three years, and
          preliminary savings are to be realized in fiscal year 2013-2014. To delay the
          project would delay the realization of any savings.</p><h4>Business Outcomes </h4><p>The output of this
          transformation is a new, enterprise-wide, centralized model and delivery of a
          standardized <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> email services.  The <abbr title="Email Transformation Initiative">ETI</abbr> project will deliver: a standard and
          consolidated email service for <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> operations; reduced costs for delivery of
          email services; a secure and reliable email services; and a common domain
          name and email address.</p><p> The final outcomes of
          <abbr title="Email Transformation Initiative">ETI</abbr> are as follows:</p><ul><li>Reduced and avoided costs;</li><li>Greening of <abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr> services;</li><li>Business needs that can be responded to in a more timely manner;</li><li>Email services that are highly available;</li><li>Email content that is secure from a confidentiality and
            integrity perspective;</li><li>Ability to develop and deploy skilled workforce; and</li><li>Partnerships with industry that are open transparent and fair.</li></ul></section></appendix></appendices><footnotes><footnote anchor="fn1" reference="fnr1" title="[1]" tooltip="Return to footnote reference 1"> A submission is an official document submitted by a sponsoring minister
