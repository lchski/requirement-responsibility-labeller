<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><doc title="Defence Scientific Service Group - Pay Plan" documentID="12120" versionID="1" language="en" space="preserve" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="PolicySchema.xsd"><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="Introduction"><p>1. The purpose of this document is to define the plan; to provide managers and employees with the information needed 
to be able to apply the plan and understand its operation; to provide a common basis for dialogue between individual 
managers about individuals and circumstances and between management and employee representatives about collective interests 
in the plan; and to promote uniform application of the plan throughout the DS Group.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Application"><p>2. This plan applies to those employed as members of the Defence Scientific Service Group in Grades DS-01 to DS-07 
(employees in Grades DS-07a, DS-07b and DS-08 are excluded from this pay plan).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Authority"><p>3. This plan was approved under TB Decision Number 769818 dated March 14, 1980, and was subsequently amended effective 
March 1<sup>st</sup>, 1999 under TB Decision Number 826950 dated February 11, 1999.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Classification"><p>4. The DS Classification and Selection Standard specifies that this is a person-oriented level description plan. 
The candidate is appointed by staffing action at a designated classification level in relation to the characteristics 
of the work to be performed and individual qualifications of the candidate.</p><p>5. The characteristics of each bargained level are summarized in the level determinants of the DS Classification 
and Selection Standard and are attached for reference in Appendix A. An examination of these determinants will show 
that they are descriptions written from a career perspective and not just from the short-term perspective of the current 
assignment and performance. The degree of complexity and responsibility of a defence scientist's assignments tends 
to increase as the employee matures (i.e. as knowledge and abilities develop with experience). The general characteristics 
associated with an individual scientist are compared with the level determinants in order to establish his or her classification 
level and state of professional development within the level. An employee's classification level is governed solely 
by the Classification and Selection Standard and the DS Promotion and Salary Advancement Guidelines produced pursuant 
to the Classification and Selection Standard, and is not a product of the Salary Progression Guidelines outlined in 
paragraphs 11 to 16 below.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Implementation"><section anchor="5.1" title="Merit review"><p>6. The purpose of the DS Merit Review is to assess the state of professional development of individual scientists 
and to determine promotions and appropriate salary progression.</p><p>7. Actions resulting from a Merit Review shall be implemented effective April 1 of each year.</p><p>8. The Merit Review forms the basis for decisions to promote, withhold a pay increment, grant a single increment, 
grant multiple increments and grant increments over a single or double barrier on the effective date.</p><p>9. The Merit Review is a three-stage process. The first stage is the provision of information about the employee, 
with input from the employee, the immediate supervisor and the accountable manager, including assessment and salary 
recommendations from the accountable manager. The second stage involves a review of the Performance Evaluation and 
salary recommendation for each DS by a Reviewing Officer. The following types of cases shall be referred to the Defence 
Scientist Human Resource Management Committee (DSHRMC):</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>recommendations that an employee or the reviewing officer do not agree to;</li><li>recommendations for the withholding of an increment or the awarding of more than 2 increments;</li><li>recommendations for promotion to DS-03, DS-04, DS-05, DS-06 and DS-07;</li><li>unsatisfactory assessment recommendations;</li><li>cases that, in the view of the Chairperson of the DSHRMC, should be reviewed by the Committee. Employees will 
be informed if such action has been taken.</li></ol><p>Review by the DSHRMC is the third stage in the process. The DSHRMC normally consists of senior defence research 
management and members of the external scientific community. The main responsibility of the DSHRMC is to review the 
matters referred to it and to make the subsequent final decision on the resulting appointment levels and salary actions. 
It is also responsible for ensuring that classification actions are administered in conformity with the DS Classification 
Standard and that assessments, the pay plan and the standard are applied uniformly and equitably throughout the population 
of employees to which they apply. When the DSHRMC changes a recommendation, an employee shall be provided with a written 
explanation of such changes.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="DS assessment"><p>10. The factors that will be used in the DS assessment process are itemized in Appendix B.</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="DS Salary progression guidelines"><p>11. The following guidelines are intended to permit progressive action towards providing employees with salaries 
consistent with their state of professional development.</p><p>12. The normal rates of salary progression within the levels will be as follows:</p><ul><li>annual increments - DS-02, DS-03, DS-06 and DS-07</li><li>annual increments - below the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05<br />   </li><li>biennial increments - crossing the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05 and at each single barrier thereafter</li></ul><p>13. Employees in DS-03, and those below the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05, may receive double increments if 
they are developing at a much faster rate than normal towards meeting the criteria for promotion to the next level.</p><p>14. Slower than normal rates of salary progression may also occur.</p><p>15. Employees will be considered for promotion after one year at the DS-01 level and after one year at the maximum 
of DS-02 and DS-03 levels, the double barrier in DS-04 and the sixth increment in DS-05. Consideration for promotion 
can occur at other points on the salary scale.</p><p>16. There may be, on occasion, an assessment recommendation of "Unsatisfactory". An unsatisfactory rating would 
occur where the evidence shows the employee's actual state of professional development to be unacceptably low by comparison 
with the normal state of professional development for the employee's grade and salary. An employee whose performance 
is assessed as "Unsatisfactory" will be denied advancement to the next step on the scale, and will be notified, in 
writing, of the decision to that effect not more than six (6) weeks and not less than two (2) weeks 
prior to the increment date.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="General"><section anchor="6.1" title="Rate of pay on initial appointment"><p>17. Entrants to the DS Group with a bachelor's degree or a bachelor's degree with limited experience will normally 
be appointed at the DS-01 level. This level will also be used for term appointments of university graduate students 
who demonstrate an interest in continuing employment within the group on completion of their graduate studies.</p><p>18. Entrants to the DS Group with a master's degree or a master's degree with limited experience will normally be 
appointed in the DS-02 range.</p><p>19. Entrants to the DS Group with a PhD degree or a PhD degree with limited experience will normally be appointed 
in the DS-03 range.</p><p>20. For experienced personnel, the rate of pay on initial appointment shall be a rate consistent with the appointment 
level and assessed state of professional development.</p></section><section anchor="6.2" title="Rate of pay on promotion"><p>21. The guidelines describe the normal points at which employees may be recommended for promotion, but they are 
not intended to prohibit promotion from any point in the pay range.</p><p>22. On promotion, an employee shall be paid a rate of pay that provides for an increase in salary that is at least 
equal to the lowest pay increment for the level to which the employee is promoted.</p><p>23. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an employee who is promoted on a day on which he or she is also eligible 
for consideration for an incremental increase, shall not normally receive that salary increment in addition to the 
salary adjustment provided by paragraph 22.</p></section><section anchor="6.3" title="Significance of barriers"><p>24. All of the single barriers in DS-03 and below the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05 are points at which the 
salary of an employee, whose state of professional development is significantly lower than normally expected, may be 
held for an additional year beyond that which is normal. In addition, the double barriers in the DS-04 and DS-05 ranges, 
all of the single barriers above the double barriers in the DS-04 and DS-05 ranges, and all the single barriers in 
the DS-06 and DS-07 pay ranges are points at which employees' salary progression may terminate because they have ceased 
to demonstrate an increase in their state of professional development.</p></section><section anchor="6.4" title="Pay increment dates"><p>25. The date on which employees shall be considered eligible for pay increment consideration will be April 1.</p><p>26. The first review date for an employee shall be April 1 following the date of initial appointment to the DS Group, 
provided that the employee has earned at least twenty-six (26) weeks of pay immediately prior to the April 1 review 
date. An employee who has not completed this minimum requirement will not be entitled to the first merit review until 
the next annual review date of April 1.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="Defence Scientific Service Group"><p>DS 01 $ _______ to _______</p><p>DS 02 $ _______  _______  _______  _______  _______</p><p>DS 03 $_______  _______  _______  /  _______  _______  /  _______  _______</p><p>DS 04 $ _______  _______  /  _______  _______  /  _______  _______  /  _______</p><p>_______  //  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______</p><p>DS 05 $ _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /</p><p>_______  //  _______  /  _______</p><p>DS 06 $ _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  ______</p><p>DS-07 $ _______  /  _______  /  _______  /  _______</p></chapter></chapters><appendices><appendix anchor="A" title="Appendix A - DS Classification Standard"><section anchor="A.1" title="Defence scientist level 1"><h4>General characteristics</h4><p>This is the recruiting and learning level for members of the group who possess a bachelor's degree or a bachelor's

to the three factors described below. The factors are intended to provide a means of assessing performance in a uniform 
manner throughout the DS Group. They will also help individual employees to appreciate the basis on which performance 
is assessed. The relative importance of each factor will depend on the nature of work, the level and the length of 
experience of the individual, and undue significance should not be attached to the order of presentation below.</p><p>1. Effectiveness and productivity in scientific research, development and analysis (SRDA)</p><p>The measures of effectiveness in SRDA are:</p><ul><li><strong>Expertise</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA"><em>connaissance techniques</em></span>) - the extent to 
	which one is capable of being a source of current, knowledgeable 
and dependable data, information, opinion and advice.</li><li><strong>Creativity</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA"><em>créativité</em></span>) - the extent to which one is the 
	source of new theoretical or experimental approaches, new 
concepts, instrumentation or systems, adaptations of existing techniques, etc. to novel situations; and the extent 
to which one sources new ideas and proposals for SRDA, whether through in-house work or as scientific authority in 
contracting out and technology-transfer activities.</li><li><strong>Productivity</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA"><em>productivité</em></span>) - the quality, quantity and value 
	of accomplishments and contributions to the department, 
whether through in-house work or as scientific authority in contracting out and technology-transfer activities.</li><li><strong>Recognition</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA"><em>reconnaissance</em></span>) - the extent to which one's 
	accomplishments and contributions in SRDA are known to, 
and accepted by, peers, colleagues and superiors.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA"><em>influence</em></span>) - the extent to which one has an effect 
	on the quality, scope or direction of departmental activities and/or the extent to which one has added to scientific or technological knowledge.</li></ul><p>2. Effectiveness and productivity in representational and human relations activities</p><p>The measure of effectiveness in these activities is acceptance as a communicator, representative, advocate and negotiator 
in SRDA matters and issues by peers, colleagues and superiors in the home establishment and elsewhere. The more important 
the matter and issues entrusted to one and the more senior and wider the circle of one's activities, the greater is 
the significance of this factor. Important areas where this factor is quite significant are technology transfer and 
industrial liaison; scientific liaison with the Canadian Forces, other agencies and countries; scientific staff and 
advisory positions; and contracting out.</p><p>3. Effectiveness and productivity in managerial activities</p><p>Management of defence SRDA involves organizing, planning and controlling diversified resources to execute the manager's 
assignments, and the provision of leadership to, and evaluation of, other scientists, engineers and/or technologists. 
The measures of effectiveness in these activities are provision of leadership; handling of complexities; obtaining, 
motivating and evaluating staff; communicating; and judgement. The managerial functions may be carried out operationally 
and executively (by line personnel and senior officers) or conceptually and consultatively (by staff and advisory personnel). 
The more important and diverse the SRDA functions and the greater the productivity and effectiveness of the functions 
managed, the greater is the significance of success in these activities.</p></appendix></appendices></doc>
