It reaffirms that English and French are the official languages of Canada and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in the institutions of the Government of Canada. The OLA stipulates the obligations of institutions in the area of official languages. The <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-48/">Official Languages (Communications withand Services to the Public) Regulations (the Regulations)</a> is the instrument implementing some of the key provisions of Part IV of the OLA in terms of communications with and services to the public. It specifies the circumstances under which the “nature” of the office or facility justifies the provision of bilingual services and sets criteria that determine whether or not there is significant demand for services in both official languages. In the latter case, the Regulations require that the most recent decennial census data be used.</clause><clause anchor="3.2"><p>This directive supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26160">Policy on Official Languages</a> by dealing with various operational aspects associated with the implementation of the Regulations, namely:</p><ul><li>The time frame for an office automatically designated bilingual under a provision relating to the nature of the office or significant demand for services to implement the measures enabling the office to fulfill its language obligations;</li><li>The time allotted to an institution to measure demand for services in both official languages and the associated terms and conditions;</li><li>The time frame for an office designated bilingual following a measurement of demand to implement the measures enabling it to fulfill its language obligations;</li><li>The cycle for updating the language obligations of offices subject to provisions relating to specific circumstances;</li><li>The terms and conditions, as well as the length of, the transition period for offices which are no longer required to provide services in both official languages; and</li><li>The establishment of a clear definition as to what constitutes restricted and identifiable clientele.</li></ul></clause><clause anchor="3.3">This directive enables the Government of Canada to minimize the risks of applications for remedy before the courts because of the non-respect, by institutions, of the rights of the public to communicate with and receive services from these institutions in the official language of their choice.</clause><clause anchor="3.4">This directive is issued by the Treasury Board pursuant to section 46 of the OLA.</clause><clause anchor="3.5">This directive must be read in conjunction with Part IV of the OLA, its Regulations, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26160">Policy on Official Languages</a> and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26164">Directive on Official Languages for Communications and Services</a>.</clause></clauses></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Definitions"><p>Refer to the <a href="#appA">Appendix</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Directive statement"><chapter anchor="5.1" title="Objective"><p>The purpose of this directive is to ensure a consistent and coherent implementation of the Regulations by specifying certain aspects therein.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5.2" title="Expected results"><ul><li>In situations where a measurement of demand for services must be conducted, institutions have determined the language obligations according to the methods and the time frames stipulated in this directive;</li><li>In situations where the principle of proportionality applies, institutions have determined the number of designated bilingual offices according to the requirements of the Regulations and of the directive, and, if necessary, have consulted the language minority population as to the choice of location of new bilingual offices;</li><li>A newly designated bilingual office has implemented measures to fulfill its language obligations within the time allotted by the directive;</li><li>Institutions have rigorously respected the time frames and terms and conditions that apply in situations where offices are no longer required to provide services in both official languages; and</li><li>Institutions have updated the language obligations of their offices according to the time allotted, as well as terms and conditions outlined in this directive.</li></ul></chapter></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Directive requirements"><chapter anchor="6.1" title="Application of the Regulations"><p>Deputy heads or their delegates are responsible for ensuring the following:</p><clauses><clause anchor="6.1.1"><a href="#office">Offices</a> that must measure the demand for services made by the public fulfill their obligations in this regard as soon as possible.

Within a Census Subdivision, the key services are the six services listed above, as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachments.</dd><dt id="office">office</dt><dd>Any location where a federal institution provides services or information to the public. It can be a post office, a border port of entry, an information counter, a toll-free service telephone number, a train, boat or plane route, or a commemorative plaque.</dd><dt id="principle">principle of proportionality</dt><dd><p>Principle taken from the Regulations according to which a federal institution with several offices in a given Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) or a Census Subdivision (CSD) must provide services in both official languages in the number of offices equal to or greater than the proportion that represents the minority compared to the total population in the CMA or CSD.</p><p>The following provisions of the Regulations concern the principle of proportionality: paragraphs 5(1) (b), (c), (g), (i) and (m).</p><p>The Regulations stipulate that the following factors must be considered in the choice of offices that provide communications and services in both official languages: the distribution of the language minority population in the region, the function of the offices, as well as their clientele and their location in the region.</p><section><h3 class="h6">Example of the application of the principle of proportionality</h3><p>Fictional CMA</p><ul><li>Total population: 147,655</li><li>Minority population: 41,850</li><li>Percentage: 28.3</li></ul><p>Almost 90% of the French-speaking population of the CMA is found in three of the seven localities that make up the CMA: 48% of the French-speaking population lives in the principal city, 22% in locality A and 20% in locality B.</p><p>Under the principle of proportionality, if 10 of the offices of a given institution offer the same services, the number of these offices that have to provide their services in both official languages should be calculated as follows: 10 × 28.3% = 2.8, or 3 offices. When the application of proportionality results in a fraction (e.g., 2.8) rather than a whole number, the figure has to be rounded to the next higher whole number. This is because the regulatory provision requires that, in comparison to the total number of the institution’s offices in the area, the number of offices offering their services in both official languages must be <strong>at least equal to or greater than</strong> the proportion of the total population that the minority represents. (If the result had been 2.3 or 2.5 out of 10, the number of offices would likewise be three.)</p><p>Since a large number of the members of the minority population live outside the principal city, it would be inappropriate to designate three offices in that city as the ones required to serve the public in both official languages.</p><p>Thus, it would perhaps be more appropriate to provide services in both official languages at two offices in the principal city and one in either locality A or B, or to offer services in both official languages at one office in each of these three localities.</p><p>The final decision will also have to take into account the function of the office and results of the consultation with the minority population.</p><p>When the principle of proportionality is applied in a CSD instead of a CMA, the number and location of offices required to provide services in both official languages are determined the same way.</p></section></dd><dt id="restricted">restricted and identifiable clientele</dt><dd><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li><p>The services specifically target a restricted clientele. The expression “restricted clientele” designates clientele of an office that has been given the mandate of providing certain services exclusively to a specific group or category of clients. The services that are covered by the restricted clientele provisions are services not available to the general public since they are intended only for clients, or their representatives, that make up a specific group that is defined in a statutory document or a government policy. This would be the case, for example, with businesses or entities carrying out activities in a regulated sector that are registered or that must secure a licence in accordance with federal legislation.</p><p>The institution must be able to show that the services in question are intended for a stable clientele, whose composition can be clearly specified. As a general rule, the clientele of an office cannot be considered a restricted clientele if the number of clients to whom an institution provides the type of services described above corresponds to more than 1% of the total population of Canada as defined in subsection 4(2) of the Regulations.</p></li><li>The clientele is identifiable. The term “identifiable” means that the name of each client and the official language in which he or she prefers to be served can be determined. The institution has an up-to-date list of its clients.</li></ol></dd></dl></appendix></appendices></doc>
