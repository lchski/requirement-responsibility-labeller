    <clauses><clause anchor="J.2.2.1">Examine separately the potential for injury that results  from a loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability. </clause><clause anchor="J.2.2.2">Assign security categories as follows:
        <clauses><clause anchor="J.2.2.2.1">A single security category that indicates the overall  impact of a compromise (see subsection J.2.3); or </clause><clause anchor="J.2.2.2.2">Separate security categories that indicate potential  impacts of losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability (see  subsection J.2.4), as applicable. </clause></clauses></clause><clause anchor="J.2.2.3">Apply the following considerations, as appropriate, when  assigning a security category:

    <clauses><clause anchor="J.2.4.1"><strong>Classified:</strong> Information is categorized as “classified” (that is, “Confidential,” “Secret”  or “Top Secret”) when unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to  cause injury to the national interest:
