    guidelines replace the following Guidelines issued on April 1, 2005:</p><ul><li><em>Guidelines
      for Demotion/Termination of Employment for Unsatisfactory Performance</em></li><li><em>Guidelines
      for Termination of Employment and Demotion for Reasons other than discipline
      (Medical Incapacity) </em></li><li><em>Guidelines for
      Rejection on Probation</em></li></ul><p>These
    guidelines support the principles set out in the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=19134">Policy Framework for
    People Management</a></em> by providing advice that will foster sound people
    management practices across the core public administration. </p><p><strong>Unsatisfactory
    Performance</strong>: Paragraph 12(1)<em>(d)</em> of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial
    Administration Act (FAA)</a></em> authorizes every deputy head in the core public administration to terminate
    employment of or demote an employee whose performance is, in the opinion of the
    deputy head, unsatisfactory. Subsection 12.2(1) permits delegation of this
    authority.</p><p><strong>Other
    Reasons</strong>: Paragraph 12(1)<em>(e)</em> of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/F-11/index.html">FAA</a> authorizes every
    deputy head in the core public administration to terminate employment of or
    demote an employee for reasons other than breaches of discipline or misconduct.
    Such actions must be for cause in compliance with subsection 12(3) of the FAA. Subsection 12.2(1) permits delegation of these authorities.</p><p><strong>During Probation</strong>: Subsection 61(1) of
    the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/index.html">Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)</a></em> authorizes the
    Treasury Board to establish, by regulation, the probationary period for classes
    of employees who are appointed from outside the public service. Subsection
    62(1) of the <em>PSEA</em> provides deputy heads with the
    authority to terminate employment during the probationary period established by
    regulation of the Treasury Board. Subsection 24(1) of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/P-33.01/index.html">PSEA</a></em> permits delegation of
    this authority. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Target Audience and Purpose"><p>These
    guidelines assist human resources advisors in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.3/section-2.html">core public administration</a> in their role of
    providing advice and guidance to management in situations such as the
    following:</p><ul><li>
      The
      employee's performance is unsatisfactory and action to demote the employee or
      terminate his or her employment is being considered;</li><li>
      Action
      to demote an employee or terminate employment for reasons other than breaches
      of discipline or misconduct is being considered. Demotion or termination for medical incapacity is the most common action.
      Demotion or termination for other reasons can also include failure to meet the
      basic requirements of the position (e.g., a valid driver's licence),
      abandonment of position, and failure to meet the security requirements of the
      position; and</li><li> Termination of
      employment during probation is being considered.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. General"><p>Upon request, the Treasury Board
    Secretariat's (TBS's) Employer Representation in Recourse Team is available to
    provide advice and guidance on demotion or termination of employment.</p><p>It is
    recommended that measures taken to act in a manner consistent with the
    following principles are a matter of record. </p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>In making
    a decision to terminate employment of or to demote an employee whose
    performance is unsatisfactory, the following guiding principles are key:
  <ul><li>
      The
      required level of job performance is determined;</li><li>
      The
      level of performance required is communicated to the employee;</li><li>
      Reasonable
      levels of supervision and instruction are provided to the employee;</li><li>
      The
      employee is allowed a reasonable period of time to meet the required level of
      job performance;</li><li>
      The
      employee is provided with reasonable warnings about the consequences of his or
      her continued failure to meet the required level of job performance; and </li><li>
      Once the
      inability to meet the required level of job performance has been established,
      reasonable alternative employment within the competence of the employee is
      considered.</li></ul><p>Please be
    mindful that jurisprudence has established that the delegated manager is to
    notify the employee in writing when a decision is made to demote him or her or
    to terminate his or her employment. The notification is to state the reasons
    for the decision and the effective date, and is to inform the employee that he
    or she has the right to grieve the decision. </p></li><li>In making
    a decision to demote an employee or terminate employment for other reasons,
    such as medical incapacity, the following guiding principles are key: 
  <ul><li>
      The
      employee has been unable to work due to illness or disability for an extended
      period, has exhausted his or her sick leave credits, and may have been granted
      leave without pay;  </li><li>
      The employee
      will not be able to return to duty within the foreseeable future. This
      determination should be based on an assessment of the employee's health, either
      by physicians of Health Canada, other medical practitioners deemed qualified by
      the employer, or both; </li><li>
      Efforts
      have been made to accommodate the employee's condition to the point of undue
      hardship, taking into consideration issues of health, safety and cost, where
      the employee is determined to be "fit for work with limitations"
      after having been examined by physicians of Health Canada, other medical
      practitioners deemed qualified by the employer, or both; </li><li>
      The
      employee has been made aware of services offered through the Employee
      Assistance Program; and </li><li>
      Other
      options, such as resignation or retirement on medical grounds, have been
      presented to the employee for consideration. </li></ul><p>Please be
    mindful that jurisprudence has established that the delegated manager is to
    notify the employee in writing when a decision is made to demote him or her or
    to terminate his or her employment. The notification is to state the reasons
    for the decision and the effective date, and is to inform the employee that he
    or she has the right to grieve the decision. </p></li><li>In making
    a decision to terminate employment during the probationary period, the
    following guiding principles are key:
  <ul><li>
      The
      employee on probation knows the specific job duties and requirements of the
      position; </li><li>
      The
      employee on probation is aware of the required standard(s) of performance and
      appropriate conduct:;</li><li>
      The
      employee on probation receives feedback when performance or conduct requires
      improvement; and </li><li>
      The
      employee on probation receives the appropriate training for the position. </li></ul></li></ol><p>The
    probationary period is to assess the suitability of the employee for the
    position for which he or she has been hired. This assessment can include an
    evaluation of the following, as appropriate:</p><ul><li>
      The
      employee's reliability, including attendance at work; </li><li>
      The
      employee's compatibility with colleagues or clients; </li><li>
      The
      employee's ability to meet work requirements, including those associated with
      the workload; and </li><li>
      The
      employee's ability to adhere to established policies, procedures, practices and
      codes of conduct. </li></ul><p>Please be
    mindful of jurisprudence which has established that a decision to proceed with
    a termination of employment during probation should be based on objective and
    demonstrable grounds and must not be made arbitrarily, in a discriminatory
    manner, or in bad faith. That is, a manager or supervisor should be satisfied
    that the employee is not suitable for the position, and should be able to
    demonstrate that he or she has acted in good faith based on the employee's
    unsuitability for the position. The grounds for such a decision could include
    unsatisfactory performance or misconduct. </p><p>The employee
    is to be notified by the delegated manager in writing of the decision to
    proceed with a termination of employment during probation, stating the reason
    for the decision and the effective date.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.&#xD;&#xA;Definitions"><dl><dt><strong>demotion</strong> (<span xml:lang="fr-CA" lang="fr-CA"><em>rétrogradation</em></span>)</dt><dd><p>An action taken
