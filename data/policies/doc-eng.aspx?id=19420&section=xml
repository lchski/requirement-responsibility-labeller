heads and departmental managers in meeting their responsibilities under the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525">Policy on Transfer Payments</a></em> and the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208">Directive on Transfer
Payments</a></em> as they relate to performance measurement strategies (see the <a href="#appappA">Appendix</a> for relevant excerpts from both the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525">Policy on Transfer Payments</a></em> and the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208">Directive on Transfer
Payments</a></em>).</p><p>A performance measurement strategy (PM strategy) in
the context of a transfer payment program is the selection, development and
ongoing use of performance measures for decision-making in the context of
program management. A PM strategy will assist in ensuring that there is
adequate and relevant information to support deputy heads and departmental
managers in:</p><ul><li>the continuous <strong>monitoring</strong> and assessment of the <strong>results</strong> of
the transfer payment program including its relevance and effectiveness as well
as the efficiency of the management of the program;</li><li>making <strong>informed decisions</strong> and taking appropriate <strong>timely action</strong>
with respect to the transfer payment program, including the amendment or
termination of terms and conditions and/or funding agreements, where
appropriate;</li><li>supporting <strong>statutory</strong> requirements under section 42.1 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial
Administration Act</a></em><sup><a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1" title="See footnote 1">[1]</a></sup> and ensuring that the information gathered will support an evaluation or
review of relevance and effectiveness of the transfer payment program and
inform decisions on the continuation, amendment or termination of the terms and
conditions; and</li><li>providing effective departmental <strong>reporting</strong> on the relevance and effectiveness
of the transfer payment program.</li></ul><p>The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525">Policy on Transfer
Payments</a></em> requires a deputy head to establish a PM strategy for a
transfer payment program at the time of program design, and ensure that it is
maintained and updated throughout the life cycle of the program. This requirement
is consistent with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18218">Policy on Management Resources
and Results Structures</a></em> which sets out the expectation that departments collect and use sound financial and non-financial program
performance information as articulated in the department's Program Alignment
Architecture.</p><p>This guideline, which
focuses specifically on performance measurement strategies for transfer payment
programs, is a companion document to <em><a href="/cee/dpms-esmr/dpms-esmrtb-eng.asp">Supporting Effective Evaluations – A
Guide to Developing Performance Measurement Strategies</a></em> which provides a step-by-step process for identifying and
planning for the collection of performance information to effectively support program
evaluation.<sup><a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2" title="See footnote 2">[2]</a></sup>
 In preparing a PM strategy for a transfer payment program, consultation
with the departmental evaluation function and/or departmental performance
measurement advisors in its development is strongly encouraged. These units
have subject matter expertise in the selection of performance measures or
indicators and in data collection. They can also offer assurance that the PM
strategy will effectively support an evaluation of the transfer payment
program.  Consultation with other departmental functions, such as the corporate
planning function, is encouraged as well.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2 Elements of a PM strategy for transfer payment programs"><p>A PM strategy for transfer payment programs should
include, as a minimum, the elements identified in the following figure.</p><p class="alignCenter"><strong>Figure 1: Elements of a PM Strategy for Transfer Payment
Programs</strong></p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><ul><li>Select performance measures or indicators</li><li>Identify data requirements to support each of the performance measures or indicators</li><li>Identify sources of data</li><li>Identify targets and timelines for achievement of performance measures or indicators</li><li>Identify means and
        methods to be used to collect data</li><li>Establish responsibilities
        for collection</li><li>Determine frequency
        of collection</li><li>Determine responsibilities
        for data analysis and synthesis, and reporting</li></ul></div><section anchor="2.1" title="2.1 Performance measures or indicators"><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><ul><li>Select performance
  measures or indicators</li></ul></div><p>The PM strategy should identify the performance
measures or indicators to be used. The key measures and indicators must be
included in the terms and conditions of the transfer payment program and should
be selected to: </p><ul><li>measure the progress of the transfer payment program toward its desired
results and its achievement of departmental and government objectives;  </li><li>be useful in the measurement of the <strong>relevance </strong>and<strong>
effectiveness</strong> of the transfer payment program;</li><li>include the measurement of <strong>efficiency </strong>of the transfer payment
program;</li><li>meet any defined reporting requirements and effectively support
evaluation;</li><li>be valid and reliable;</li><li>be sufficient in numbers bearing in mind the availability of data and the
cost of collection of the data that would be required to support them.</li></ul><p>Where a transfer payment program is shown as a
distinct program within a department's Program Alignment Architecture (PAA) and
performance measures have been identified in the department's supporting
Performance Measurement Framework, the PM strategy should reflect these
performance measures. In cases where a transfer payment exists as a component
within a program in the PAA, the Performance Measurement Framework should also
be reviewed for any relevant, pre-existing performance measures that could be
referenced in the PM strategy.</p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="2.2 Required data"><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><ul><li>Identify data requirements to support each of the performance measures or indicators</li><li>Identify sources of data</li><li>Identify targets and timelines for achievement of performance indicators</li></ul></div><p>The PM strategy should identify the data that will be
required to support each of the selected performance measures or indicators and
identify the sources of this data. There may be some repetition between this
step and step 2.1 above.  As the availability and cost of collection of data is
explored, it may prove necessary or desirable to redefine performance measures or
indicators. </p><p>Sources of data may include:</p><ul><li><strong>Administrative records</strong> and internal databases relating to the
management of the transfer payment program;</li><li><strong>Reports from recipients</strong>: it is important to identify the data
that will be collected from recipients. This has to be described in the terms
and conditions of the transfer payment program, and be identified in funding
agreements;</li><li><strong>Specialized data collection exercises</strong> such as focus groups,
expert panels or surveys;</li><li>Data collected for other purposes such as <strong>national statistics</strong>,
e.g. Statistics Canada.</li></ul><p>Specific targets should also be established for each performance measure
or indicator identified as they are important for effective monitoring and for
assessing the progress of the transfer payment program.</p></section><section anchor="2.3" title="2.3 Data collection"><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><ul><li>Identify means or
        methods to be used to collect data</li><li>Establish responsibilities
        for collection</li><li>Determine frequency
        of collection </li></ul></div><p>The PM strategy should set out the means or methods to
be used to collect data, and clearly identify the responsibilities for
collection and when it is to be done. Not all data needs to be or can be
collected with the same frequency.  The key determinants are the availability
of the data, the proposed use of the data, and reporting requirements.  Ongoing
collection will ensure that data will be available for timely reporting and at
the time of evaluation.  Baseline data may need to be established for
measurement purposes.</p></section><section anchor="2.4" title="2.4  Reporting"><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><ul><li>Determine responsibilities for data analysis and synthesis, and reporting</li></ul></div><p>To be useful, the data collected under the PM strategy
has to be converted into relevant information and used for decision making and
reporting. The PM strategy should identify the responsibilities for data
analysis and data synthesis, and for internal and external reporting in
relation to the transfer payment program.</p><p>Reporting content and frequency should support ongoing
tracking of the performance of the transfer payment program and support timely
decisions and actions where necessary to improve program performance or program
delivery.</p><p>The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525">Policy on Transfer
Payments</a></em> requires deputy heads to ensure there are cost-effective
performance measurement and reporting<strong> systems</strong> in place to support the
management of transfer payments.  </p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3 Maintenance of PM strategy"><p>The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525">Policy on Transfer
Payments</a></em> requires that a deputy head ensure that the PM strategy for a
transfer payment program is maintained and updated throughout the life cycle of
the program. The PM strategy is to be an evergreen document that is changed as
required to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in meeting its
purposes. Consultation with the departmental evaluation function is encouraged,
especially as program managers are responsible for implementing and updating
the PM strategy to ensure that it is relevant to the program and that credible
and reliable performance data are being collected to effectively support
evaluation.<sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3" title="See footnote 3">[3]</a></sup>
 Consultation with other stakeholders is also encouraged.</p><p>Updating of the strategy may be required for reasons
such as:</p><ul><li>The measures or indicators chosen are proving not to be valid, reliable
and credible;</li><li>Better data sources have become available;</li><li>Data collection is proving to be difficult or expensive;</li><li>Program design and terms and conditions are modified.</li></ul><p>The PM strategy is a departmental document for
internal use.  Although this document does not need to be approved by or sent
to the Treasury Board Secretariat, it may be shared for developing common
understanding and knowledge of the transfer payments programs.</p></chapter></chapters><appendices><appendix anchor="appA" title="Appendix"><h3>Excerpts from the <em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></h3><h4>6.5 Deputy Heads are responsible for:</h4><p>6.5.2  Ensuring that a performance measurement strategy is established at the time of program
