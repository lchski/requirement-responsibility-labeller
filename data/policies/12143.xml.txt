In 1918, when the Act was first passed, arrangements were made whereby the provincial workers' compensation boards would look after the treatment of injured employees and would adjudicate and pay compensation claims on behalf of the Government of Canada. These arrangements remain in existence today. The Labour Program’s Federal Workers’ Compensation Service at ESDC is responsible for receiving and processing claims through to the appropriate provincial authority. They provide a general advisory service to employees and unions, as well as to employers, on the interpretation and application of the legislation.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3.

(For further information regarding the proper completion of the applicable provincial "Employer's Report of Accident" form in relation to occupational codes, please refer to appendix A following this chapter.)</p><p>Personnel officers are also responsible for the development and communication to employees of appropriate directives and instructions concerning the details of reporting occupational injuries and illnesses to their employer.

The form, together with any supporting documentation, must be completed and forwarded within three working days to the Labour Program’s Federal Workers’ Compensation Service at ESDC. As the claim is processed, certain information is recorded for accounting and statistical purposes, and it is at this stage that work-injury data must be obtained.</p><p>Departments and agencies are to ensure that the applicable employee occupational code is entered on each "Employer's Report of Accident" form to accurately identify the employee's occupation. The employee classification code is the occupational group/sub-group portion of the class code as contained in the Government of Canada Personnel Pay Input Manual, Section 9-3.
