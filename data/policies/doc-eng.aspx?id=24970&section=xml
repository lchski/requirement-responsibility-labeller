indicates that all three subprocesses should be completed before proceeding to the Manage Contracts subprocess group.</p><p><strong>Note B:</strong> When the purchase is determined to be an asset, the cost of deliverables is an input to the following Materiel/Finance Interactions domain processes: Manage Other Capital Assets (Business Process 4.1), Manage Real Property (Business Process 4.2) and Manage Inventory (Business Process 4.3).</p><p>As illustrated in Figure 1, the Manage Procure to Payment business process comprises nine subprocesses (3.1.1 to 3.1.9) that are arranged in six subprocess groups as follows.</p><p><strong>Manage Requirements</strong> is the start of the Manage Procure to Payment business process, beginning with the approved budget and approved plan from Manage Planning and Budgeting (Business Process 1.1), or an ad hoc requirement. It involves defining requirements, determining the corresponding expenditure initiation authority, and preparing requisitions for goods and services. Depending on the nature of the requirement, coordination may be required between asset/materiel management services, the manager defining the goods and services required, and the manager with delegated spending authority to initiate expenditures.</p><p><strong>Control Commitments</strong> involves ensuring that there is a sufficient unencumbered balance as well as creating and updating commitments prior to entering or amending the contract
pursuant to section 32 of the FAA. Control Commitments connects to three subprocess groups: Manage Requirements, to create the commitment; Manage Contracts, if there are amendments to the contract;
and Manage Payables, to close the commitment on the payment of the final invoice for the contract. The manager is accountable for Control Commitments, in accordance with department-specific
policy.</p><p><strong>Manage Contracts</strong> involves creating and/or amending the contract as well as determining and exercising the appropriate transaction authority. Most of these activities are
considered materiel management in nature rather than financial, but they provide important context and link the financial and contracting processes. The role accountable for the transaction authority
will depend on whether the authority has been delegated to the department or whether it rests with the Department of Public Works and Government Services.</p><p><strong>Administer Contracts and Deliverables</strong> is a point of integration with the business processes from the Materiel/Finance Interactions domain for the management of assets. It involves
monitoring the contract, receiving and accepting deliverables (part of account verification in support of section 34 of the FAA), monitoring financial performance, and resolving vendor issues. Most
of these activities are materiel management in nature rather than financial, but they provide important context and link the financial and contracting processes. Responsibility for administering the
contract is shared among several organizational roles, while the manager is ultimately accountable for the outcome.</p><p><strong>Manage Payables</strong> involves handling invoices, completing account verification, and providing certification authority, pursuant to section 34 of the FAA. The manager is responsible
and accountable for these activities.</p><p><strong>Manage Payments</strong> ends the Manage Procure to Payment business process and involves the performance of quality assurance activities where applicable, exercising payment authorization
pursuant to section 33 of the FAA, completing and submitting payment requisitions, and finalizing payments. When quality assurance is not performed, the process proceeds to Manage Post-Payment
Verification (Business Process 8.1). When quality assurance is performed, the process proceeds to Manage Financial Close (Business Process 8.2). Financial services is responsible for managing payment
requisitions, certifying payments (section 33 of the FAA), and recording payments, while the Banking and Cash Management Sector of the Receiver General is responsible for issuing payments.</p><p>Throughout the Manage Procure to Payment business process, there are instances where the vendor master data file will need to be updated; the connection points to Manage Vendor Master Data File
(Business Process 7.1) are provided in <a href="#toc541">Manage Contracts (Subprocess 3.1.5)</a>, <a href="#toc551">Administer Contracts and Deliverables (Subprocess 3.1.6)</a>, and <a href="#toc561">Manage Payables (Subprocess 3.1.7)</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="1" title="1. Date of Issue"><p>This guideline was issued on January 10, 2012.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Context"><p>This guideline is part of a set of guidelines designed to assist departments in developing departmental business processes that are common across the Government of Canada, in support of the
objectives of the <em>Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</em> and the <em>Directive on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</em>.</p><p>This guideline presents the “should be” model for Mange Procure to Payment, describing roles and responsibilities and recommended activities from a financial management perspective.
Most activities are financial in nature, but in certain cases non-financial activities are included in order to provide a comprehensive description. The recommended activities comply with the
requirements of <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, other legislation, and Government of Canada policy instruments.</p><p>Recognizing that the deputy head is ultimately responsible for all aspects of financial management systems within his or her department, standardizing and streamlining financial management system
configurations, business processes and data across government provides significant direct and indirect benefits relative to the quality of financial management in the Government of Canada.</p><p>By establishing a common set of rules in place of many, standardization reduces the multitude of different systems, business processes and data that undermine the quality and cost of
decision-making information. As government-wide standardization is increased, efficiency, integrity and interoperability are improved.<a href="#ftn1" name="ftnref1" title="See footnote 1" id="ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Introduction"><section anchor="3a" title="3.1 Scope and Structure of the Guideline"><h4>3.1.1 Scope</h4><p>This guideline defines Manage Procure to Payment, which begins with the identification of procurement need and ends with a finalized payment issued by the Receiver General. This common financial
business process focuses on expenditures that involve operational or capital procurement using a purchase order or other type of contract.</p><p>The scope of this guideline covers the following six subprocess groups:</p><ul><li>Manage Requirements;</li><li>Control Commitments;</li><li>Manage Contracts;</li><li>Administer Contracts and Deliverables;</li><li>Manage Payables; and</li><li>Manage Payments.</li></ul><p>Other operational expenditures, such as travel-related expenditures, are described in Manage Travel (Business Process 3.2). Expenditures or payments not involving formal procurement contracts,
expenditures related to second and subsequent payments for multi-year contracts, non-pay employee-related transactions, and payments related to the relocation of employees are described in Manage
Other Payments (Business Process 3.3). Payments to other government departments are described in Manage Interdepartmental Settlements (Business Process 2.2).</p><p>Some financial management activities described in the business process are also related to internal controls. The intent is neither to provide a complete listing of controls, nor to produce a
control framework; however this model may enrich a department’s control framework.</p><h4>3.1.2 Structure of the Guideline</h4><p>The remainder of this guideline is structured as follows: Section 4 provides an overview of the organizational roles that carry out Manage Procure to Payment. Section 5 presents a detailed
description of the Manage Procure to Payment business process, including subprocess groups, subprocesses, activities, and responsible organizational roles. <a href="#appA">Appendix A</a> provides definitions of
terminology used in this guideline, and relevant abbreviations are listed in <a href="#appB">Appendix B</a>. <a href="#appC">Appendix C</a> describes the methodology used in the guideline, and <a href="#appD">Appendix D</a> elaborates on the roles and
responsibilities outlined in Section 4. Purchases made with an acquisition card, which are considered a variation of the Manage Procure to Payment business process, are described in <a href="#appE">Appendix E</a>.</p></section><section anchor="3b" title="3.2 References"><p>The following references apply to this guideline.</p><h4>3.2.1 Acts and Regulations</h4><ul><li><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html"><em>Government Contracts Regulations</em></a></li><li><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/FullText.html"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a> (sections 7, 29, 32, 33, 34 and 41)</li><li><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-130/index.html"><em>Payments and Settlements Requisitioning Regulations,1997</em></a></li></ul><h4>3.2.2 Policy Instruments</h4><ul><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15790"><em>Account Verification, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12176&amp;section=text"><em>Accounting Standard 3.1 - Treasury Board - Capital Assets</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17059"><em>Acquisition Cards, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12025"><em>Common Services Policy</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494"><em>Contracting Policy</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12038"><em>Decision Making in Limiting Contractor Liability in Crown Procurement Contracts, Policy on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060"><em>Delegation of Financial Authorities for Disbursements, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15791&amp;section=text"><em>Departmental Bank Accounts, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17061"><em>Expenditure Initiation and Commitment Control, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14005"><em>Financial Management Governance, Policy on</em></a></li><li><a href="/mm-gm/doc/gfm-ggpa/c1-00-eng.aspx"><em>Fleet Management, Guide to,</em> Chapter 1: “Light-Duty Vehicles”</a></li><li><a href="/mm-gm/doc/gfm-ggpa/c2-00-eng.aspx"><em>Fleet Management, Guide to,</em> Chapter 2: “Executive Vehicles”</a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12064&amp;section=text#cha4"><em>Fleet Management: Executive Vehicles, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12065"><em>Fleet Management: Light Duty Vehicles, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15258&amp;section=text"><em>Internal Control, Policy on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18225"><em>Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services, Policy on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12409"><em>Knowledge for Required Training, Standards on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12405&amp;section=text"><em>Learning, Training and Development, Policy on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12022"><em>Management of Assets and Acquired Services, Policy Framework for the</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062"><em>Management of Materiel, Policy on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229&amp;section=text"><em>Management of Projects, Policy on the</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18218"><em>Management, Resources and Results Structure, Policy on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18929"><em>Payment, Collection and Remittance of Provincial Taxes and Fees, Directive on the</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15784"><em>Payment Requisitioning and Cheque Control, Directive on</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17590&amp;section=text"><em>Stewardship of Financial Management Systems, Directive on the</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589"><em>Stewardship of Financial Management Systems, Policy on the</em></a></li></ul><h4>3.2.3 Other References</h4><ul><li><a href="/mrrs-sgrr/about-apropos/instructions-consignes/services-eng.asp"><em>Government of Canada Internal Services Definitions</em></a></li><li><a href="/maf-crg/index-eng.asp"><em>Management Accountability Framework</em></a></li><li><a href="http://publiservice.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/cars-sccr/casd/rggl/documents-e.html"><em>Receiver General Control Framework</em></a></li><li><a href="http://publiservice.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/rg/text/recgen-e.html"><em>Receiver General Manual</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13854"><em>Treasury Board Submissions, A Guide to Preparing</em></a></li></ul></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.

means that all three subprocesses should be completed before proceeding to the Manage Contracts subprocess group.</p><p><strong>Note B:</strong> When the purchase is determined to be an asset, the cost of deliverables is an input to the following Materiel/Finance Interactions domain processes: Manage Other Capital
Assets (Business Process 4.1), Manage Real Property (Business Process 4.2) and Manage Inventory (Business Process 4.3).</p><p>The subprocesses within each subprocess group and the roles and responsibilities relevant to each process are summarized below.</p><h4>Manage Requirements</h4><ul><li><strong>Determine Requirements (Subprocess 3.1.1):</strong> Based on the approved budget and the approved plan, or an ad hoc requirement, the need for a good or service is identified,
    and requirements, such as type of goods, quantity, and estimated costs, are defined by the manager.</li><li><strong>Determine/Exercise Expenditure Initiation Authority (Subprocess 3.1.2):</strong> The manager requesting the requirement should ensure that he or she has been delegated the
    appropriate expenditure initiation authority, and exercise or obtain that authority.<a href="#ftn7" name="ftnref7" title="See footnote 7" id="ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Typically, this subprocess is performed concurrently
    with Verify Unencumbered Balance (Subprocess 3.1.3) and Manage Commitments (Subprocess 3.1.4), pursuant to section 32 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (FAA).</li></ul><h4>Control Commitments</h4><ul><li><strong>Verify Unencumbered Balance (Subprocess 3.1.3):</strong> Before preparing the requisition, the manager needs to ensure that a sufficient unencumbered balance is available in an
    appropriation.<a href="#ftn8" name="ftnref8" title="See footnote 8" id="ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></li><li><strong>Manage Commitments (Subprocess 3.1.4):</strong> After confirmation of a sufficient unencumbered balance is established, a commitment is recorded and updated according to department-specific policy<a href="#ftn9" name="ftnref9" title="See footnote 9" id="ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> by one of the following:

    verification in support of section 34 of the FAA), and managing issues. The manager, supported by asset/materiel management services, is accountable for administering the contract. Receiving
    deliverables involves the physical receipt of goods or deliverables and the acceptance or rejection of goods or services based on damage, quantity, or other criteria, as defined by the terms and
    conditions of the contract.</li></ul><h4>Manage Payables</h4><ul><li><strong>Manage Payables (Subprocess 3.1.7):</strong> Following receipt of the invoice, account verification pursuant to section 34 of the FAA is performed. Certification authority is exercised by the manager,<a href="#ftn11" name="ftnref11" title="See footnote 11" id="ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> and a request for payment is prepared and sent to financial services.</li></ul><h4>Manage Payments</h4><ul><li><strong>Perform Payment Authority (Subprocess 3.1.8):</strong> Manage Payments starts with the receipt of a request for payment. During the payment process, quality assurance is
    performed by financial services as part of exercising payment authority pursuant to section 33 of the FAA.<a href="#ftn12" name="ftnref12" title="See footnote 12" id="ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></li><li><strong>Issue Payment (Subprocess 3.1.9):</strong> The payment requisition is sent to the Receiver General for payment issuance.

    to Manage Financial Close (Business Process 8.2).</li></ul><p>Although the use of an acquisition card is not mandatory, it is strongly encouraged when the purchase is within delegated transaction authority and it is efficient, economical and operationally
feasible to do so.<a href="#ftn14" name="ftnref14" title="See footnote 14" id="ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> An alternative flow is provided in <a href="#appE">Appendix E</a> to illustrate the process when an acquisition card is used.</p></section><section anchor="5b" title="5.2 Manage Requirements"><p>Manage Requirements is the start of the Manage Procure to Payment business process, beginning with the approved budget and approved plan from Manage Planning and Budgeting (Business Process 1.1), or an ad hoc requirement. It involves defining requirements, determining the corresponding expenditure initiation authority, and preparing the requisition for a good or service.</p><p>A key aspect of this subprocess group is the coordination of the work of the responsibility centre manager – financial management, the responsibility centre manager – acquisitions, and
asset/materiel management services. In some cases, the roles of responsibility centre manager – financial management and the responsibility centre manager – acquisitions are performed by
the same individual. However, there may be situations when the individual does not have all the delegated authority for exercising financial and spending authorities or where the individual’s
delegated authority is not sufficient for a particular requisition. In these cases, the roles of responsibility centre manager – financial management and the responsibility centre manager
– acquisitions are performed by different individuals.</p><h4 id="toc521">5.2.1 Determine Requirements (Subprocess 3.1.1)</h4><p>Based on the approved budget and the approved plan, or an ad hoc requirement, the need for a good or service is identified; requirements, such as type of good or service, quantity, statement of
work or tasks, dates required and estimated costs, are defined by the manager; and the appropriate procurement vehicle options are selected. Figure 4 depicts the Level 3 process flow for Determine
Requirements.</p><p><strong>Figure 4. Determine Requirements (Subprocess 3.1.1) – Level 3 Process Flow</strong></p><p><img src="/pol-cont/24970-05-eng.gif" width="582" height="326" alt="Figure 4. Determine Requirements (Subprocess 3.1.1) – Level 3 Process Flow" id="ldr4" longdesc="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24970&amp;section=longdeschtml&amp;ld=4" /></p><h5>5.2.1.1 Activities</h5><p>The degree of complexity involved in defining requirements for goods and services will depend on the type of good or service required and/or the procurement vehicle selected. Based on the approved
budget and expected outcomes as detailed in the approved plan, or an ad hoc requirement, the need to acquire resources is identified by the manager (Activity 3.1.1.1 – Identify Goods/Services
Needed). Responsibility centre managers with delegated expenditure initiation authority are usually the initiators of the Manage Procure to Payment business process.</p><p>The detailed specifications for goods or services to be acquired are then identified (Activity 3.1.1.2 – Define Requirements). A requisition for procurement is drafted, detailing the type of
good or service, the item description, the estimated cost, quantity and milestones.</p><p>It is important to examine the nature of the purchase to ensure that tangible assets that should be capitalized are identified early in the procurement process and that the financial coding is
correct. Such assets may be acquired, constructed or developed and would also include leasehold improvements and betterments to existing assets. <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12176&amp;section=text"><em> Accounting Standard 3.1 - Treasury Board - Capital Assets</em></a> provides guidance on how to determine which tangible assets should be capitalized.</p><p>The financial coding against which the expenditure is to be charged is then identified, including the appropriate responsibility centre, authority, appropriations (operations and maintenance
versus capital) and subactivity.</p><p>Based on the defined requirements, the appropriate procurement vehicle options are identified (Activity 3.1.1.3 – Examine and Select Procurement Vehicle Options). Typically, items of
low-dollar value can be purchased with an acquisition card or a call-up against a standing offer; items of high-dollar value require a formal bidding process.</p><p>Discussions between the manager, functional specialists, asset/materiel management services, and the Department of Public Works and Government Services – Acquisitions Branch may be required
to define the requirements more precisely and to clarify the contracting options and constraints, the nature of the goods/services, the duration of the contract and the date of delivery, the
estimated cost, and the specific requirements (e.g., the level of security clearance and official languages). Functional specialists may also be consulted (e.g., Environment Canada when performing an
environmental assessment, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police when procuring security-related goods or services, and IT specialists when purchasing or developing computer software or hardware).</p><p>The purchaser should also consult the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12025"><em>Common Services Policy</em></a>, which specifies that departments are to obtain goods and certain services
through common service organizations unless a department has been delegated the procurement authority through other Treasury Board policies, by specific Treasury Board exemption, by specific
departmental legislation, or in the provisions of the <em>Common Services Policy</em>.</p><h5>5.2.1.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>For this subprocess, there are typically two potential scenarios relating to accountability. In scenario one (S1), asset/materiel management services is accountable for the purchase of certain

minister and the deputy head, where expenditure initiation authority is defined as “the authority to incur an expenditure or to make an obligation to obtain goods or services that will result
in the eventual expenditure of funds.

delegation documents (Activity 3.1.2.1 – Determine Required Expenditure Initiation Authority). When the manager does not possess the required expenditure initiation authority, he or she should
obtain the signatures of those with delegated authority (Activity 3.1.2.2 – Exercise or Obtain Authority). In some situations, the manager may not obtain the authority to initiate the
expenditure, in which case the procurement requirement may be redefined or the expenditure initiation process ends.</p><p>Certain complex situations may arise for large projects, such as the acquisition of real property, the undertaking of new projects, or purchases related to a major Crown project, which may require
project or expenditure initiation approval from outside the department. For example, new projects of high-dollar value or high risk will require the manager to ensure that the authority is adequately

This subprocess group
involves monitoring the contract, receiving and accepting deliverables (part of account verification in support of section 34 of the FAA), monitoring financial performance, and resolving vendor
issues. Most activities of this subprocess are materiel management in nature and are outside the financial management scope of this process, but they provide important context and link the financial
and contracting processes. In some cases, it may be necessary to revisit <a href="#toc541">Manage Contracts (Subprocess 3.1.5)</a>, for example, when the contract requires amendments.</p><h4 id="toc551">5.5.1 Administer Contracts and Deliverables (Subprocess 3.1.6)</h4><p>Subprocess 3.1.6 involves monitoring the contract, certifying the receipt and acceptance of deliverables (pursuant to section 34 of the FAA), reviewing financial performance, and managing vendor
issues. The manager, supported by asset/materiel management services, is accountable for administering the contract. Receiving deliverables involves the physical receipt of deliverables and either
accepting or rejecting deliverables based on damage, quantity, or other criteria, as defined by the contract. Figure 9 depicts the Level 3 process flow for Administer Contracts and Deliverables.</p><p id="fig9"><strong>Figure 9.

Assets (Business Process 4.1), Manage Real Property (Business Process 4.2) and Manage Inventory (Business Process 4.3).</p><h5>5.5.1.1 Activities</h5><p>The contract should be regularly monitored (Activity 3.1.6.1 – Monitor Contract) to ensure that:</p><ul><li>Milestones are achieved;</li><li>The vendor continues to be a going concern;</li><li>The vendor meets the terms and conditions of the contract;</li><li>The goods or services meet the requirements of the contract; and</li><li>The total value of the contract is sufficient.</li></ul><p>At any time during the contract period, events may trigger the need for action to be taken relating to the contract, the vendor information or the vendor.</p><p>The Administer Contracts and Deliverables subprocess also involves the physical receipt of goods and performing an inspection, or confirming receipt of services. In some cases, there may
be multiple locations or designated receiving areas within the department where the goods are delivered. For goods, the physical receipt process results in a receiving document; and for services, in
a documented acknowledgement of services received. Data such as quantity and item description are matched with the receiving document (Activity 3.1.6.2 – Match Deliverables With Receiving
Document). Evidence of the receipt is part of the account verification, in support of section 34 of the FAA (<a href="#toc561">Manage Payables (Subprocess 3.1.7)</a>).<a href="#ftn42" name="ftnref42" title="See footnote 42" id="ftnref42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></p><p>The deliverables are then compared to the terms and conditions of the contract (Activity 3.1.6.3 – Match Deliverables With Contract). Any discrepancies are noted and resolved with
the vendor. If no discrepancies are noted or once they are resolved, the deliverables are officially accepted as part of the certification of the receipt of goods or the provision of services
pursuant to section 34 of the FAA,<a href="#ftn43" name="ftnref43" title="See footnote 43" id="ftnref43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> supported by documentation such as a bill of lading, a deliverable, a time sheet, or a notice of

“persons with delegated authority do not exercise the following:</p><ul><li>Certification authority and payment authority on the same payment;</li><li>Spending, certification or payment authority for an expenditure from which they can directly or indirectly benefit (e.g., when the payee is the individual with financial signing authority or when the expenditure is incurred for the benefit of that individual).”<a href="#ftn45" name="ftnref45" title="See footnote 45" id="ftnref45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></li></ul><p>Goods and certain services may be recorded as an expense, an inventory item (Business Process 4.3 – Manage Inventory), or as a capital asset (Business Process 4.1 – Manage
  Other Capital Assets or Business Process 4.2 – Manage Real Property) along with the related liability. If not done previously, an analysis of the nature of the deliverables or goods may be
  required when it is not evident how the purchase should be recorded. This analysis is especially vital when the acquisition could be a component for an asset under construction, a betterment or a
capital lease. An accrual entry may be recorded to reflect the receipt of the good or service, and the applicable updates are made to commitments.</p><p>In the event of the rejection of deliverables or a discrepancy in the receiving document, it is necessary to resolve these issues with the vendor (Activity 3.1.6.4 – Resolve Issues
With Vendor). The vendor needs to be contacted to resolve the issue, which may result in returned goods, a modification to the deliverable, or a contract amendment.</p><p>Goods that are damaged or that are in excess of what was ordered are returned in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. The vendor is contacted and advised of the issue.
Usually when goods are returned to the vendor, a Return Merchandise Authorization form is completed and sent with the returning merchandise. Goods to be returned can result in several
outcomes:</p><ul><li>The goods can be replaced or exchanged for an alternative when the original goods are not available;</li><li>The vendor can adjust or revise the invoice; or</li><li>The vendor can issue a refund or credit memo for the portion of goods returned.</li></ul><p>There may be instances when the issue can be resolved without returning the goods or rejecting the deliverables, that is, where they are accepted as received. This resolution may impact
the value of the contract, for example, if the deliverables are accepted at a discount of the original price.</p><p>If the contract needs to be amended, it will be necessary to revisit <a href="#toc541">Manage Contracts (Subprocess 3.1.5)</a> and to proceed with the review and finalization of the terms and conditions of the
contract (Activity 3.1.5.2 – Finalize/Review Terms and Conditions) following the appropriate flow of activities. There may be circumstances when additional entities may be
consulted, most notably legal counsel, to ensure that issues are resolved. The contract and corresponding commitments should be adjusted to reflect the final resolution agreed upon by all
parties.</p><p>The vendor master data file may require changes, such as a change in location or payment data, over the course of the contract. It is important to record changes when they become known.
Certain vendor master data file changes may also trigger a contract amendment, for example, when a vendor undergoes a legal name change. Manage Vendor Master Data File (Business Process 7.1) provides
details on how to make changes to the vendor master data file.</p><p>When deliverables are paid for by acquisition card, rather than proceeding to Manage Payables (Subprocess 3.1.7), the process would proceed to the performance of certification of the
credit card statement, pursuant to section 34 of the FAA. The alternative process flow for acquisition cards is described in <a href="#appE">Appendix E</a>.</p><h5>5.5.1.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>The key financial management activities of this subprocess are ensuring that the receiving documents accurately describe the deliverables received and that the deliverables match what was
requested. Responsibility for administering the contract is shared among several roles, while the manager is ultimately accountable for the outcome. The remaining activities are materiel management
in nature.</p><p>There are various scenarios relating to responsibility and accountability.</p><p>For Activity 3.1.6.1 – Monitor Contract, corporate contracting and materiel, the Department of Public Works and Government Services – Acquisitions Branch or the responsibility
centre manager – acquisitions is responsible for this activity. When the manager is responsible, the Department of Public Works and Government Services – Acquisitions Branch could be
consulted for their expertise and the manager – acquisitions would be informed of issues when he or she was not responsible for monitoring the contract. The manager – acquisitions is
always accountable.</p><p>For Activity 3.1.6.2 – Match Deliverables With Receiving Document and Activity 3.1.6.3 – Match Deliverables With Contract, when the responsibility centre manager
– financial management and the responsibility centre manager – acquisitions are not the same individual, the manager – financial management is informed of the results of activities
3.1.6.2 and 3.1.6.3, which are part of the account verification process in <a href="#toc561">Manage Payables (Subprocess 3.1.7)</a>.</p><p>For Activity 3.1.6.3 – Match Deliverables With Contract, the type of deliverables will determine which role is responsible, typically based on the technical expertise required to
confirm compliance to the specifications of the contract. In scenario one (S1), asset/materiel management services is responsible. In scenario two (S2), the manager – acquisitions is
responsible. In both cases, however, the manager remains accountable.</p><p>For Activity 3.1.6.4 – Resolve Issues With Vendor, the role responsible will depend on how the transaction authority was exercised. In scenario two (S2), the manager –
acquisitions is responsible. In scenario three (S3), corporate contracting and materiel is responsible. In scenario four (S4), the Department of Public Works and Government Services –
Acquisitions Branch is responsible. In all cases, the manager is accountable for this activity.</p><p>Table 6 provides an overview of roles and responsibilities for this subprocess, using the Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) approach. These roles and

Departments that fail to pay by the due date<a href="#ftn52" name="ftnref52" title="See footnote 52" id="ftnref52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> must pay interest, without demand from the supplier, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. The <em>Directive on Payment Requisitioning and Cheque
Control</em> does not allow the department to elect a minimum threshold for payment of interest. For information on determining the due date, see the “Payment on due date” section of the
<em>Directive on Payment Requisitioning and Cheque Control</em>. Typically, the payment term starts when the invoice is received at the invoicing address specified in the contract; this is the
invoice receipt date for purposes of calculating the due date. The department has an obligation to record the invoice receipt date as follows:</p><ul><li>Paper invoices should date stamped; or</li><li>Electronic invoices should have a date tag applied that cannot be changed electronically.</li></ul><p>The “goods/services acceptance date” is the date of delivery to the department (Activity 3.1.6.2 – Match Deliverables With Receiving Document). The quality of the deliverables received is determined as part of the FAA section 34 certification process (Activity 3.1.6.3 – Match Deliverables With Contract).</p><p>Account verification also involves confirming that advance payments meet appropriate requirements<a href="#ftn53" name="ftnref53" title="See footnote 53" id="ftnref53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> and comply with the <em>Treasury Board</em> <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494"><em>Contracting Policy</em></a>. Recurring periodic payments for ongoing contracts, such as utilities and facilities, are described in Manage Other
Payments (Business Process 3.3).</p><p>If, at any point during the account verification process, a discrepancy is noted or if the information is incomplete, the manager is required to resolve the discrepancy by tracing the issue to its
source (Activity 3.1.7.9 – Resolve Discrepancies). Once the issue is resolved, the account verification may resume or start over.</p><p>Once the invoice has been verified and no discrepancies or issues have been noted, the account verification is complete and certified pursuant to section 34 of the FAA (Activity 3.1.7.10 –
Exercise or Obtain Authority), which is usually provided through a signature block on the invoice or a completed account verification checklist. The invoice is recorded and the need to adjust the
commitment is determined, such as in the case of a final invoice. If the invoice is not certified, follow-up with the vendor or others involved in the Manage Procure to Payment business process may
be required. The final output of the Manage Payables subprocess group is an approved invoice in the form of a payment request for the purpose of payment processing.</p><p>Account verification pursuant to section 34 of the FAA also involves ensuring that there is auditable evidence of verification (i.e., ensuring that the process identifies the individuals who
performed the account verification and ensuring that there is an audit trail).</p><h5>5.6.1.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>The responsibility centre manager – financial management is responsible and accountable for the completion of the account verification and the certification of invoices pursuant to section 34 of the FAA.</p><p>Table 7 provides an overview of roles and responsibilities for this subprocess, using the Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) approach.

Through its analysis, this guideline recognizes five levels of detail for any financial management business process.</p><h4>Process Model Levels</h4><p>As illustrated in Figure 13, the Level 1 model represents the highest level and least detailed view of the financial management business process. It provides a graphical business process representation of financial management in the Government of Canada that applies to all functional domains and cross-functional areas.</p><p id="fig13"><strong>Figure 13. Level 1 Model of Financial Management</strong></p><p><img src="/pol-cont/24970-14-eng.jpg" alt="Figure 13.

This process description is aimed at the executive level. It is
elaborated at Level 2 through definition of subprocesses. Some subprocesses on Level 2 diagrams will be used for more than one business process, to reflect integration points between business
processes.</p><p>A Level 3 business process flow is aimed at the process specialist level and provides more detail to a Level 2 subprocess through identification of activities, while remaining common to all
departments and system-independent.</p><p>Once defined, departments, agencies and cluster groups can tailor the Level 3 descriptions to address organizational needs and system-specific or system-dependant concerns. These very detailed
business processes (i.e., Level 4 and Level 5) are considered unique to departments and systems and are outside the scope of this guideline.</p><h4>Process Diagrams</h4><p>Process diagrams are used to describe processes (Level 2) and subprocesses (Level 3).

(purchases, inventory, asset accounting) and may be directly associated with an employee or position. Administrative officers and staff provide the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Real property services</strong> to ensure that real property is managed in a sustainable and financially responsible manner throughout its life cycle, to support the
    cost-effective and efficient delivery of government programs. Real property is defined as any right, interest or benefit in land, which includes mines, minerals and improvements on, above or below
    the surface of the land.</li><li><strong>Materiel services</strong> to ensure that materiel can be managed by departments in a sustainable and financially responsible manner to support the cost-effective and
    efficient delivery of government programs. Materiel is defined as all movable assets, excluding money and records, acquired by Her Majesty in right of Canada. Materiel management entails all
    activities necessary to acquire, hold, use and dispose of materiel, including the notion of achieving the greatest possible efficiency throughout the life cycle of materiel assets; and</li><li><strong>Acquisition services</strong> (formerly Procurement Services) to acquire a good or service to fulfill a properly completed request (including a complete and accurate
