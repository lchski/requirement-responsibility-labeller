Manage Planning and Budgeting – Level 2 Process Flow</a></p></div><p>As illustrated in Figure 1, Manage Planning and Budgeting comprises 11 subprocesses (1.1.1 to 1.1.11). These are arranged in five subprocess groups, as follows. </p><p><strong>Develop Notional Budget Allocations</strong> is the start of the Manage Planning and Budgeting business process and involves the development of notional budget allocations to responsibility centres and other planning dimensions, including authorities, objects of expenditure, program activities and projects.</p><p><strong>Develop Revenue, Operating and Transfer Payment Plans and Budgets</strong> involves the development of operational plans and related budgets that are aligned with departmental objectives, priorities, assumptions and constraints. Depending on the structure of the department's budget, not all subprocesses or activities will apply. For example, Develop Transfer Payment Budget (Subprocess
    1.1.5) applies only to departments that administer transfer payments.</p><p><strong>Develop Project Plan and Budget</strong> involves the identification, assessment, planning and approval of projects throughout the fiscal year. These activities support the deputy head in meeting his or her responsibility for ensuring that a department-wide project management governance and oversight mechanism is in place to manage the initiation, planning, execution, control and
    closing of projects.<sup><a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2" name="ftnref2"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[2]</a></sup> Although the other activities within the Manage Planning and Budgeting business process occur before the start of the fiscal year, the activities within the Develop Project Plan and Budget subprocess group may occur at any point in the year, as new projects are
    identified.</p><p><strong>Develop Investment Plan and Budget</strong> involves activities to ensure that capital asset life-cycle requirements, project portfolio plans, and planned investments in acquired services are considered in the development of the departmental investment plan and budget. These activities support the requirement that effective investment planning should ensure a diligent and rational
    manner of resource allocation for both existing and new assets, and for acquired services.<sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3" name="ftnref3"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[3]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Consolidate and Approve Plans and Budgets</strong> involves the consolidation, review, challenging and approval of plans and budgets. Options to address budget pressures or to use surplus funds effectively are also reviewed and approved. Approved budgets are then communicated to responsibility centre managers.</p><p>Throughout the Manage Planning and Budgeting business process, plans and budgets are developed and rolled up at various levels within the department. For example, activities within the Develop Revenue, Operating and Transfer Payment Plans and Budgets subprocess group are typically conducted by various responsibility centre managers and rolled up by business unit, whereas activities within the
    Develop Investment Plan and Budget subprocess group are conducted using a more centralized approach, within an organization-wide investment management framework. Activities are often completed concurrently because the resulting budgets (revenue, operating, transfer payments, capital assets and project portfolio), pressures, surpluses and risks are interdependent across activities.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="1" title="1.

Context"><p>This guideline is part of a set of guidelines designed to assist departments<sup><a href="#ftn4" id="ftnref4" name="ftnref4"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[4]</a></sup> in implementing common financial management business processes. This guideline supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589"><em>Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</em></a> and the <em>Directive on the Stewardship of
    Financial Management Systems</em>.</p><p>This guideline presents the “should be” model for Manage Planning and Budgeting, describing roles, responsibilities and recommended activities from a financial management perspective. Most activities are financial in nature, but some non-financial activities are included in order to provide a comprehensive process description; these activities are identified as outside the scope of
    Managing Planning and Budgeting. The recommended activities comply with the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, other legislation, and Government of Canada policy instruments.</p><p>Recognizing that deputy heads are ultimately responsible for all aspects of financial management systems within their department, standardizing and streamlining financial management system configurations, business processes and data across government provides significant direct and indirect benefits relative to the quality of financial management in the Government of Canada. By establishing a
    common set of rules, standardization reduces the multitude of different systems, business processes and data that undermine the quality and cost of decision-making information. As government-wide standardization increases, efficiency, integrity and interoperability are improved.<sup><a href="#ftn5" id="ftnref5" name="ftnref5"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[5]</a></sup></p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Introduction"><section anchor="3_1" title="3.1 Scope"><p>This guideline defines Manage Planning and Budgeting, which begins with the Annual Reference Level Update as an input to identify the notional departmental budget and ends with the approval of annual budgets allocated to responsibility centres and other planning dimensions, including authorities, objects of expenditure, program activities and projects. This process is generally completed
        before the beginning of the fiscal year. </p><p>This guideline covers the following subprocess groups:</p><ul><li>Develop Notional Budget Allocations;</li><li>Develop Revenue, Operating and Transfer Payment Plans and Budgets;</li><li>Develop Project Plan and Budget;</li><li>Develop Investment Plan and Budget; and</li><li>Consolidate and Approve Plans and Budgets.</li></ul><p>Some financial management activities described in this guideline are also related to internal controls. The intent is neither to provide a complete listing of controls, nor to produce a control framework; however, this model may provide useful content for the development of a department's control framework.</p></section><section anchor="3_2" title="3.2 Structure of the Guideline"><p>The remainder of this guideline is structured as follows.

Manage Planning and Budgeting – Level 2 Process Flow</a></p></div><p>The subprocesses within each subprocess group and the roles and responsibilities relevant to each subprocess are summarized below.</p><p><strong>Develop Notional Budget Allocations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Develop Notional Budget Allocations (Subprocess 1.1.1):</strong> The planning and budgeting process begins with the Annual Reference Level Update as an input to the development of notional budget allocations to responsibility centres and other planning dimensions, including authorities, objects of expenditure, program activities and projects. Notional budget allocations are
            envelopes within which responsibility centre managers develop their detailed annual budgets. In addition, an integrated planning package, which provides planning instructions and timelines and which may provide high-level planning priorities assumptions and constraints, is prepared for managers with planning and budgeting responsibilities.</li></ul><p><strong>Develop Revenue, Operating and Transfer Payment Plans and Budgets</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Conduct Operational Planning (Subprocess 1.1.2):</strong> Based on the notional budget allocations and the integrated planning package, operational plans are developed at the business-unit level. These plans outline the activities that business units will undertake to help the department achieve its strategic objectives. Operational plans include key performance indicators and may
            include requirements for human resources, information management and information technology, office accommodations and communications. Note that operational planning is largely a non-financial function and therefore is outside the scope of the Manage Planning and Budgeting business process.</li><li><strong>Develop Revenue Budget (Subprocess 1.1.3):</strong> The revenue budget is developed to validate the amount of expected revenue forecast in the Annual Reference Level Update. The budget outlines the expected revenue by program or source and by responsibility centre for the fiscal year, taking into account assumptions, constraints, historical trends and current information. When
            revenue is respendable, the budget will be an input to Develop Operating Budget (Subprocess 1.1.4).</li><li><strong>Develop Operating Budget (Subprocess 1.1.4):</strong> Based on operational plans and resource requirements, the operating budget is developed. The operating budget is divided into salary and non-salary components.</li><li><strong>Develop Transfer Payment Budget (Subprocess 1.1.5):</strong> Based on transfer payment plans, the transfer payment budget for each program is allocated, taking into account any related assumptions and constraints.</li></ul><p><strong>Develop Project Plan and Budget</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Conduct Project Planning and Budgeting (Subprocess 1.1.6):</strong> Projects are identified, assessed, planned and approved throughout the fiscal year. The resulting approved projects are an input to the Develop Investment Plan and Budget subprocess group.</li></ul><p><strong>Develop Investment Plan and Budget</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Conduct Capital Asset Life-Cycle Planning and Budgeting (Subprocess 1.1.7):</strong> Based on the current approved investment plan and budget, the notional budget allocations, the integrated planning package and any asset assessment results, the capital asset life-cycle requirements are identified, prioritized, budgeted and validated. Requirements may be either capital in nature
            (relating to new assets or betterments) or non-capital in nature (relating to asset repairs and maintenance or minor capital).</li><li><strong>Conduct Acquired Services Planning and Budgeting (Subprocess 1.1.8):</strong> Acquired services requirements and budgets from the capital asset life-cycle and project portfolio plans are summarized. Other operational acquired services requirements are also estimated.</li><li><strong>Conduct Project Portfolio Planning and Budgeting (Subprocess 1.1.9):</strong> Budget allocations for in-progress, newly approved, and additional potential projects are validated. The project portfolio plan and budget may also include an allocation of funds to a reserve, to allow flexibility in allocating funds to additional projects during the fiscal year.</li><li><strong>Update Internal Investment Plan and Budget (Subprocess 1.1.10):</strong> Based on the capital asset life-cycle, acquired services, and project portfolio plans and budgets, the internal investment plan and budget are updated.</li></ul><p><strong>Consolidate and Approve Plans and Budgets</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Consolidate and Approve Plans and Budgets (Subprocess 1.1.11):</strong> Plans and budgets are consolidated, reviewed, challenged and approved at the departmental level. Options to address budget pressures or to effectively use surplus funds are also reviewed and approved. Approved budgets are then communicated to responsibility centre managers.</li></ul><p>Throughout the Manage Planning and Budgeting business process, plans and budgets are developed and rolled up at various levels within the department. For example, activities within the Develop Revenue, Operating and Transfer Payment Plans and Budgets subprocess group are typically conducted by various responsibility centre managers and are rolled up by business unit, whereas activities within
        the Develop Investment Plan and Budget subprocess group are conducted using a more centralized approach, within an organization-wide investment management framework. Activities are often completed concurrently because the resulting budgets and plans (revenue, operating, transfer payments, capital assets and project portfolio), pressures, surpluses and risks are interdependent across subprocesses.
        Once completed, all plans and budgets are consolidated, reviewed, challenged and approved at the departmental level.</p></section><section anchor="5_2" title="5.2 Develop Notional Budget Allocations"><h4>5.2.1 Develop Notional Budget Allocations (Subprocess 1.1.1)</h4><p>The planning and budgeting process begins with the Annual Reference Level Update as an input to the development of notional budget allocations to responsibilities centres and other planning dimensions, including authorities, objects of expenditure, program activities and projects. Corporate finance is responsible for developing the notional budget allocations, which are envelopes within which
        responsibility centre managers develop their detailed annual budgets.</p><p>Figure 6 depicts the Level 3 process flow for Develop Notional Budget Allocations.</p><div id="ldr6" class="alignCenter"><p><em><strong>Figure 6.

Develop Notional Budget Allocations (Subprocess 1.1.1) – Level 3 Process Flow</a></p></div><h5>5.2.1.1 Activities</h5><p>The initial departmental budget for the fiscal year is confirmed by comparing the Annual Reference Level Update approved by the Treasury Board with the amounts submitted by the department through the Annual Reference Level Update process <strong>(Activity 1.1.1.1 – Confirm Annual Reference Level Update Budget Allocation)</strong>.</p><p>The current-year funds that the department can potentially carry forward to the next fiscal year are estimated using the current-year total annual forecast <strong>(Activity 1.1.1.2 – Estimate Departmental Carry-Forward)</strong>. The maximum amount of carry-forward depends on the stipulation related to lapsing appropriations specified in the department's enabling legislation—the
        <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a> or a department-specific act—and the type of vote. For example, Treasury Board permits some departments to carry forward a percentage of the organization's Main Estimates operating budget to the next fiscal year, based on lapses reported in the Public Accounts of Canada. In addition, some
        departments with separate capital votes in the Main Estimates may also carry forward a percentage of their capital vote to the next fiscal year.</p><p>New funding adjustments (for example, Treasury Board submissions, collective agreement adjustments, frozen allotments and budget reductions) that have been approved by the Treasury Board but that have not yet been included in the Estimates are identified <strong>(Activity 1.1.1.3 – Identify Treasury Board-Approved Funding Adjustments)</strong>. Typically, departments receive confirmation
        of these adjustments through Treasury Board Information Notices or through consultation with their Treasury Board Secretariat program analyst.</p><p>Based on the confirmed initial departmental budget outlined in the Annual Reference Level Update, the carry-forward estimate and the funding adjustments approved by the Treasury Board, notional budgets are developed and allocated to responsibility centres and other planning dimensions, including authorities, objects of expenditure, program activities and projects <strong>(Activity 1.1.1.4
        – Develop Notional Budget Allocations)</strong>. Whether funds are ongoing (A-base) or sun-setting (B-base) should also be considered when allocating funds to responsibility centres and providing instructions for planning against these funds.</p><p>When applicable to the department's financial risk management strategy, the allocation of notional budgets may also include a departmental budget contingency or reserve. If used, contingencies and reserves should be established within a framework that clearly defines how the funds are managed, used and monitored. Departments should consider the risks of allocating budgets in excess of
        parliamentary-approved funding (for example, carry-forward and funding adjustments approved by the Treasury Board) and should develop appropriate risk mitigation measures.</p><p>An integrated planning package is prepared for managers with planning and budgeting responsibilities <strong>(Activity 1.1.1.5 – Develop and Communicate Integrated Planning Package)</strong>. The planning package provides instructions and timelines for completing the planning and budgeting process. The instructions provide managers with guidance on conducting operational and investment
        planning and budgeting, and integrate both financial and non-financial components. To help align planning and budgeting with the department's overall strategic objectives and operational requirements, the planning package may also provide a summary of high-level planning priorities, assumptions and constraints—for example, budgeting requirements outlined in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=19855"><em>Directive on the Management of Expenditures on Travel, Hospitality and Conferences</em></a> and departmental staffing objectives in support of targeted programs. Key inputs to the planning package may include prior-year plans and results—for example, the strategic plan, the Report on Plans and Priorities, the Departmental Performance Report, the investment
        plan, the three-year transfer payment plan, the integrated business plan, the corporate risk profile, the Management Accountability Framework assessment, prior-year actuals and forecasts, and prior-year budget allocations and reallocations.</p><p>Assumptions and constraints included in the planning package may need to be re-validated throughout the planning process to ensure that any new information is considered in the development of plans and budgets. The notional budget allocations against which managers should plan may also need to be revised with the changes in funding approved during the Manage Planning and Budgeting business
        process.</p><h5>5.2.1.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>Table 1 provides an overview of roles and responsibilities, using the Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed (RACI) approach.

An investment is “the use of resources with the expectation of a future return, such as an increase in output, income or assets, or the acquisition of knowledge or capacity.”<sup><a href="#ftn20" id="ftnref20" name="ftnref20"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[20]</a></sup></p><p>The senior departmental manager sponsoring the project validates the potential project to ensure alignment with departmental objectives <strong>(Activity 1.1.6.2 – Validate Potential Project)</strong>. Potential projects may be identified on an ad hoc basis throughout the fiscal year or as part of  Conduct Capital Asset Life-Cycle Planning and Budgeting (Subprocess 1.1.7).
        Validation criteria should be established to determine which projects should continue to the business case development phase, as the development of business cases can often consume significant departmental resources.</p><p>When the validated potential project is planned to start in the current or the next fiscal year, the responsibility centre manager develops a business case for presentation to the investment management governance <strong>(Activity 1.1.6.3 – Develop Business Case)</strong>. When a validated potential project is planned to start in a future year (beyond the next fiscal year), it should be
        considered during</p><p>Conduct Project Portfolio Planning and Budgeting (Subprocess 1.1.9). Alternatively, the development of the business case may be deferred until a future year.</p><p>A business case typically describes the alignment of the project to departmental strategic objectives and the program outcomes expected to be achieved, and provides a cost-benefit analysis and an analysis of the options considered. The business case should also include the resource requirements by fiscal year for the duration of the project, as well as a description of the significance of the
        project to the department's overall investment plan. The Treasury Board Secretariat's <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12251"><em>Guide to Costing</em></a> provides guidance on developing a business case.</p><p>Based on departmental business case approval criteria and taking into account all other potential projects validated as part of the Conduct Project Planning and Budgeting subprocess, the business case is reviewed for approval by the investment management governance <strong>(Activity 1.1.6.4 – Review and Approve Business Case)</strong>.</p><p>When approval is not granted, the process ends. When approval is granted, the responsibility centre manager prepares a project brief to provide the project approval authority with a more detailed understanding of the project. The project brief summarizes the expected business outcomes, the significance of the project in achieving program and government objectives, potential project options,
        the performance indicators to be measured, and an evaluation strategy identifying critical milestones, to ensure that objectives are met.</p><p>The project brief is also supported by the following key project initiation components:</p><ul><li><strong>Project charter:</strong> A description of the project's purpose, objectives, guiding principles, scope, schedule and budget <strong>(Activity 1.1.6.5 – Develop Project Charter)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Project management plan:</strong> A description of the performance and outcome measures; evaluation strategy; accountability for outcomes; governance and project team structure, roles and responsibilities; and communication plan <strong>(Activity 1.1.6.6 – Develop Project Management Plan)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Assessment of project risks and complexities:</strong> An assessment of the level of risk and complexity for the purposes of project approval authority, conducted in accordance with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229"><em>Policy on the Management of Projects</em></a><sup><a href="#ftn21" id="ftnref21" name="ftnref21"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[21]</a></sup> and the
