Effective Date"><p>This guideline takes effect <!--time datetime="2016-04-14"-->April 15, 2016<!--/time-->.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Context"><p>The purpose of this guideline is to provide a framework and practical guidance for Chief Financial Officers (<abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s) in the <a href="#diligence">due diligence <span class="wb-inv">(see definition)</span></a> review and <a href="#attestation">attestation <span class="wb-inv">(see definition)</span></a> they provide on the financial management aspects of Cabinet <a href="#submission">submissions <span class="wb-inv">(see definition)</span></a>. This review and attestation is to meet the expectations of deputy heads (<abbr title="Deputy Head">DH</abbr>s), ministers, central agencies and cabinet committees; to support informed decision making in the Government of Canada; and to promote a coherent and consistent approach to <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> due diligence review across government. While the level of due diligence and attestation can vary depending on the specific proposal, strategic business decisions must consider the effective, efficient and economical use of government resources, based on the best information currently available.</p><p>Given their broad responsibilities under the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14005"><em>Policy on Financial Management Governance</em></a>, <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s are well positioned to assess the financial information provided in key decision-making documents and to provide expert conclusions on its utility for decision making. This guideline elaborates on the roles and responsibilities of <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s as set out in the <em>Policy on Financial Management Governance</em> and in the procedures for submissions.</p><p>The <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s signed Attestation Letter is included as an appendix to Treasury Board (TB) submissions. The appropriate Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) officer should be consulted early in the process if there is a question as to whether <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> attestation is required. For Memoranda to Cabinet, the Privy Council Office's (PCO) <a href="http://www.pco.gc.ca/index.asp?doc=mc/mc-eng.htm&amp;lang=eng&amp;page=information&amp;sub=publications"><em>A Drafter's Guide to Cabinet Documents</em></a> should be consulted for specific instructions on the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s Attestation. Note that the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> attestation on the financial implications of a submission does not constitute assessment of policy or program effectiveness.</p><p>This guideline does not apply to Crown Corporations. <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s of portfolio departments are not expected to attest to Crown Corporation submissions which are routed through the department for ministerial approval. For additional guidance about Crown Corporations, contact your <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> program sector analyst.</p><p>This guideline should also be read in conjunction with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18796"><em>Policy on Financial Resource Management, Information and Reporting</em></a> and other <a href="#cha5">relevant documents</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Roles of CFOs and Senior Departmental Managers"><p>As the accounting officer for the department, the deputy head is ultimately responsible for the development and preparation of submissions and for obtaining the sponsoring minister's sign-off. Both the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> and <a href="#srdeptmgrs">senior departmental managers <span class="wb-inv">(see definition)</span></a> play important roles in developing the submission and in supporting due diligence and attestation.</p><p>As the initiative's proponent, senior departmental managers normally define the policy direction. Further, as described in the <em>Policy on Financial Management Governance</em>, they are responsible for exercising financial management authorities, responsibilities and accountabilities; for managing in a prudent manner financial resources entrusted to them; and for complying with legislation, regulations and Treasury Board (TB) policies, directives and standards.</p><p>The policy also notes that the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s challenge and attestation role is based on corporate financial stewardship and as an objective strategic business adviser on matters such as risk management, the examination of financial options and cost containment. Overall, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> is mandated to provide objective and independent advice to the <abbr title="Deputy Head">DH</abbr> as the accounting officer for the department.</p><p>There will be interdependencies between the senior departmental managers' role as the proposal's proponent and the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s overarching leadership and coordination role in financial management. It is expected that senior departmental managers and the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> will collaborate early in the proposal's development to manage these interdependencies and allow sufficient time to address any matters or opportunities identified through the due diligence review.</p><p>It is also recommended that the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> and the sponsoring program ADM review and document their respective areas of responsibility to ensure there are no material errors or omissions. As a best practice, <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s should complete their due diligence after the sponsoring program ADM has completed their review and signed-off on the submission. This practice reflects the fact that a <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s due diligence is dependent on the program organization's proposal.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. CFO Attestation"><p>This section details the six assertions used to assess the financial information in a submission, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s attestation conclusions, and the communication of the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s expert determinations to decision makers.</p><section anchor="4.1" title="4.1. Assertions"><p>Six fundamental assertions have been identified to characterize the elements of attestation and to convey the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s attestation conclusions in support of decision making. The assertions in Table 1 and <a href="#appA">Annex A</a> are rooted in the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s roles and responsibilities as defined by the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> financial management policies. In the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s Attestation Letter, the assertions are expressed in plain language so as to be easily understood by decision makers and non-financial experts.</p><p>Based on their professional judgment and experience, <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s have flexibility in their Attestation Letter. They can make detailed observations related to a specific assertion in order to appropriately reflect different situations, or an assertion can be noted as "not applicable" when it is not relevant to a proposal. For each assertion, <a href="#appB">Annex B</a> provides rationales, criteria, sub-criteria and examples to support <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s in their due diligence review.</p><h4>Table 1. Six Fundamental Assertions</h4><div class="well well-sm label-info"><p><abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> Assertions</p><ol><li>The nature and extent of the proposal is reasonably described and material <a href="#assumption">assumptions <span class="wb-inv">(see definition)</span></a> having a bearing on the associated financial requirements have been disclosed and are supported.
						</li><li>Significant risks having a bearing on the financial requirements, the sensitivity of the financial requirements to changes in key assumptions, and the related risk-mitigation strategies have been disclosed.</li><li>Financial resource requirements have been disclosed and are consistent with the assumptions stated in the proposal, and options to contain costs have been considered.</li><li>Funding has been identified and is sufficient to address the financial requirements for the expected duration of the proposal.</li><li>The proposal is compliant with relevant financial management legislation and policies, and the proper financial management authorities are in place or are being sought through the proposal.</li><li>Key financial controls are in place to support the implementation and ongoing operation of the proposal.</li></ol></div></section><section anchor="4.2" title="4.2. Due diligence review"><p>Before providing attestation, <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s will conduct a robust due diligence review. It is expected that this review will be based at a minimum on the principles and criteria outline in Annex B of this guideline.</p><p>Questions concerning the reasonableness, completeness, reliability, relevancy and other related considerations of the proposal should be asked by <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s to test the integrity of the financial information, financial resource requirements and overarching financial framework associated with the proposal. <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s are expected to exercise their professional judgment in determining when the principles and criteria in Annex B have been satisfied, and they must be prepared to justify their decisions accordingly.</p><p>When <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s are unsure as to whether their due diligence review is sufficient, they are encouraged to consult with their deputy head, the program sector analyst or the Office of the Comptroller General.</p></section><section anchor="4.3" title="4.3. CFO Attestation Letter"><p>An Attestation Letter formally communicates the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s final assertions, observations and overall conclusions based on the due diligence exercised on the information available as of the date of signature (see Annex A for a model <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> Attestation Letter). The Attestation Letter uses common language approach to readily convey the essential information to non-financial experts and decision makers.</p><p>The <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s signed Attestation Letter is included as an appendix to <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> submissions. The <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada">TBS</abbr> <a href="/tbs-pct/index-eng.asp"><em>Guide to Preparing Treasury Board Submissions</em></a> should be consulted for more detailed instructions on positioning the Attestation Letter within a <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Submission. For Memoranda to Cabinet, the <abbr title="Privy Council Office">PCO</abbr>'s <a href="http://www.pco.gc.ca/index.asp?doc=mc/mc-eng.htm&amp;lang=eng&amp;page=information&amp;sub=publications"><em>A Drafter's Guide to Cabinet Documents</em></a> should be consulted for specific instructions on the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s Attestation.</p><h4>4.3.1. Tailoring for Memoranda to Cabinet and Treasury Board submissions</h4><p>While the fundamental criteria for a financially sound proposal apply to both Memoranda to Cabinet (<abbr title="Memoranda to Cabinet">MC</abbr>s) and <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> submissions, there are differences in practice and expectations that may have an impact on the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s due diligence review. Due to the range of possible scenarios and inherent differences in such <a href="#submission">submissions <span class="wb-inv">(see definition)</span></a>, <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s will have to strike the appropriate balance in the necessary due diligence process.</p><p>Specific characteristics that may influence the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s due diligence include the following:</p><ul><li><abbr title="Memoranda to Cabinet">MC</abbr>s generally cover strategic-level policy or program approvals, or approvals in principle, and usually present options that have less proposal certainty than in a <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> submission and estimates that have greater variability and more limited financial detail.</li><li>Legislative initiatives that are being proposed through an <abbr title="Memoranda to Cabinet">MC</abbr> should be assessed as part of an attestation and the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> should assess the estimated financial impact if the legislation was enacted.</li><li>TB submissions generally deal with a specific initiative at the point of its implementation where the level of operational and financial information is usually more certain, which allows for a more in-depth process than at the typical <abbr title="Memoranda to Cabinet">MC</abbr> stage. In a <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> submission, decision makers expect greater evidence and more rigour regarding cost-containment considerations, including options analysis, to inform the detailed operational conclusions.</li><li>For continuity, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s due diligence review activities completed at the <abbr title="Memoranda to Cabinet">MC</abbr> stage should be leveraged and augmented for the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s conclusions at the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> submission stage.</li><li>In all cases a <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> attestation is expected to encompass all options contained in the submission, not just the recommended option.</li></ul><h4>4.3.2. Formulating assertion statements and observations</h4><p>It is expected that the Attestation Letter will cover all six fundamental assertions. The standard assertion text should be used for consistency to support the clarity and value of the sign-off for decision makers.</p><p>It is recommended that any material observations or concerns regarding a specific assertion be detailed as part of, or directly following, the assertion itself. Such observations are those specific matters deemed by the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> to be relevant for financial decision-making purposes. The observation's tone and language should also convey its nature and importance. Where criteria are not satisfied by the proposal, where critical information may be missing or inadequate, or where the due diligence has been limited, observations may arise where these elements are significant.</p><p>If, for example, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> has reservations about one or more of the options presented, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> should discuss these reservations with the departmental proponent.</p><p><abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s may need to involve other functional heads in the department, such as the Chief Audit Executive (<abbr title="Chief Audit Executive">CAE</abbr>), Chief Information Officer (<abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr>) and the Chief of Human Resources to explore statements and assumptions that have financial implications.</p><h4>4.3.3. Overall conclusion</h4><p>The Attestation Letter includes the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s overarching opinion on the sufficiency of the proposal's information for decision making on financial resource implications. This opinion takes into account the six assertion statements and any observations made. The <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> should be prepared to justify the final conclusion based on the due diligence and professional judgment applied.</p><p>At the earlier approval-in-principle, conceptual phases of an initiative, decisions may need to be made on the basis of preliminary information and estimates resulting in a high degree of cost uncertainty, and the attendant financial implications. The cost uncertainty decreases as more information about the initiative or program is developed.</p><p>Where a <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> is unable to assess or has identified a substantial financial risk (conclusions 2 and 3 below), in addition to consulting departmental managers and the <abbr title="Deputy Head">DH</abbr>, it is recommended that the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> consult with the <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> Program Sector and the Office of the Comptroller General, Financial Management Sector in order to understand the central agency perspective. One of the objectives of the additional consultation is to ensure Central Agencies have advanced awareness of any uncertainty or increased risk associated with a Cabinet submission.</p><p>The following types of opinions are drawn based on the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s due diligence, professional judgment and knowledge:</p><h5>1. Sufficient information for decision making</h5><p>Where no concerns or observations have been noted, <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>s use their professional judgment to conclude that the financial information is sufficient overall to support decision making.</p><p>If limited concerns or observations have been noted, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> may still conclude that there is sufficient information for decision making on financial resource implications. The <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> may wish to highlight an observation or observations that warrant additional focus by decision makers.</p><p>Standard text:</p><blockquote><p><em>"In my opinion, the financial information contained in this proposal is sufficient overall to support decision making."</em></p></blockquote><h5>2. Unable to assess</h5><p>Where the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> judges that there is insufficient time to gather additional information or perform due diligence on the information that supports decision making, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> may conclude that he or she is unable to assess the financial aspects of the proposal. This could occur in circumstances such as when the time frame is exceedingly tight for the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s due diligence, when the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> is engaged too late in the process, or when significant changes to the financial information have been made just before the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s attestation.</p><p>An "unable to assess" conclusion may not necessarily preclude a proposal from going forward. However, it is likely to be perceived that there is a high degree of uncertainty in the financial aspects of the proposal which may have implications on the decision making process.</p><p>Where the degree of uncertainty is significant and the submission goes forward, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> may recommend to the program ADM that they implement supplementary monitoring of the initiative to ensure risks identified and mitigation strategies are implemented on a timely basis. In consultation with the program ADM, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> and ADM may also decide to provide the deputy head with periodic updates. The <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> should be disclosing the nature and extent of the uncertainty and the associated mitigation strategy in the attestation letter if it is not adequately covered in the submission.</p><p>Standard text:</p><blockquote><p><em>"In my opinion, I am unable to assess the financial implications of this proposal."</em></p></blockquote><h5>3. Substantial financial issues or risks</h5><p>In situations where the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> judges that the information contained in the proposal is insufficient to support decision making on financial implications, a positive overall conclusion is not possible. This could result from limitations on the due diligence exercised, the level or completeness of supporting information or concerns arising from a <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s professional judgment that the proposal could result in undue financial or control risks. The <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> may base this decision on one particularly critical observation or on the collective impact of a number of observations. The tone and language of the observations should be sufficiently clear to underscore and substantiate the conclusion.</p><p>An overall "substantial issues" conclusion may not necessarily preclude a proposal from going forward; however, it is likely to be perceived that a high degree of risk exists in the financial aspects of the proposal, which may affect the decision making process. It is expected that the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> would have engaged the relevant senior departmental managers and the <abbr title="Deputy Head">DH</abbr> in a timely manner, with a view to effectively resolving the issues or obtaining the necessary information. If substantial issues could not be resolved, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> will not be in a position to provide a positive attestation conclusion.</p><p>Standard text:</p><blockquote><p><em>"In my opinion, the proposal has substantial financial and/or risk issues, as noted above."</em></p></blockquote><h4>4.3.4. Documenting the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s due diligence review</h4><p>A management record needs to be appropriately maintained to document the due diligence review that supports the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s analysis, conclusions and Attestation Letter. The record should include the version of the proposal, the relevant supporting documentation, or links to it, and any key sources of information used or professional judgments made in reaching the conclusions in the due diligence process. The documentation should be sufficiently detailed for a third party to understand the scope of the due diligence and testing of the assertions and see how the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr>'s conclusions and observations in the Attestation Letter are supported.</p></section><section anchor="4.4" title="4.4. Joint and horizontal Treasury Board submissions"><p>The <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> of each department that is participating in a joint or horizontal submission must exercise due diligence. The scope of each CFOs due diligence should cover the financial implications of the submission proposals for their department.</p><p>In addition to completing their due diligence, the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> of the lead department is responsible for ensuring they have a copy of the signed <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> attestations from every participating department. An original signed copy of the attestation for each department that is a signatory to the submission should be appended to the submission. A copy of all other attestations should be retained by the lead <abbr title="Chief Financial Officers">CFO</abbr> as part of their working-paper files.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5.
