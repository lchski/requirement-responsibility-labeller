Introduction"><section anchor="1.1" title="1.1 About this Guide"><p>This guide is intended to assist departments in implementing the Treasury Board <em>Policy on Investment Planning – Assets 
and Acquired Services</em>. </p><p>The <em>Policy on Investment Planning - Assets and Acquired Services</em> is based on the principles of value for money 
and sound stewardship in the management of assets and acquired services as outlined in the Policy Framework for the Management 
of Assets and Acquired Services. The Policy Framework sets out the principles for the management of assets and acquired 
services, which are consistent with the management expectations established in the Management Accountability Framework<sup><strong><a href="#fn1" name="fnr1" title="See footnote 1">[1]</a></strong></sup>. The Policy Framework also supports the role of Treasury Board Ministers 
in making effective management and expenditure decisions in the context of assets and acquired services while ensuring Parliamentarians 
have the necessary information to ensure proper oversight of management and spending in the Estimates process.</p><p>Departmental investment planning supports the effective and efficient allocation and reallocation of resources to new 
and existing assets and acquired services. Effective investment planning, for which deputy heads are responsible, ensures 
resources are allocated in a manner that clearly supports program outcomes and government priorities. Effective management 
includes developing a departmental investment plan, exercising oversight in the implementation of investment decisions and 
ensuring appropriate, ongoing measurement of investment performance.</p><p>The guide is targeted at those responsible for, and involved in, the departmental process of investment planning.</p></section><section anchor="1.2" title="1.2 Highlights of the Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services"><p>Treasury Board approved the <em>Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</em> on June 7, 2007. This Policy supports the better and more transparent planning and management of investments within departments 
and agencies and across the Government of Canada as an enterprise, by clarifying the responsibilities of deputy heads for 
investment planning. The Policy, which replaces the <em>Policy on Long-term Capital Plans</em><sup><strong><a href="#fn0" name="fnr0" title="See footnote *">[*]</a></strong></sup>, 
requires that all departments<sup><strong><a href="#fn2" name="fnr2" title="See footnote 2">[2]</a></strong></sup> and agencies develop, at a minimum, 
a five-year investment plan that describes the planned use of government resources. Organizations are expected to highlight 
priority investments which reflect the areas of greatest risk for the department and best support Government of Canada objectives. 
The investment plan will also outline upcoming projects and consider the assessed capacity of the department to manage those 
projects. Treasury Board Ministers will have the opportunity to review the department's investment plan, gain insight into 
its investment planning process, and provide strategic direction at least once every three years.</p><p><em>The Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</em> is designed to:</p><ul><li>Clarify accountability: Deputy heads are responsible for the effective 
  management of the investment planning function within their department.</li><li>Promote effective and integrated investment planning: Effective investment planning ensures resources are allocated 
  in a manner that clearly supports program outcomes and government priorities within existing departmental reference levels.</li><li>Be flexible: Investment planning should meet departmental planning needs and reflect the operational environment in 
  which the department is expected to deliver on its mandate. Deputy heads have the flexibility to tailor the investment 
  planning process to best meet the department's specific operational requirements, in consideration of the minimum 
  expectations outlined in the policy.</li></ul><p>The <em>Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</em><sup><a href="#fn3" name="fnr3" title="See footnote 3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></sup> 
has five areas of focus:</p><ol><li>Providing the deputy head and TB Ministers with the departmental context in which investments are planned and undertaken.</li><li>Detailing investments in both assets and acquired services, including all associated resources.</li><li>Enabling Treasury Board consideration of the management practices which support the planning process, not just the 
  resulting plan.</li><li>Emphasizing the planning process, including governance and decision-making, points of accountability, roles and responsibilities, 
  planning and investment performance and risk management.</li><li>Promoting strategic oversight and highlighting complex and high-risk investments for deputy heads, Treasury Board 
  Secretariat officials and Treasury Board Ministers.</li></ol><p>As many of the key departmental investments are managed as projects, it is important to recognize the links between this 
policy and other relevant Treasury Board policies. In particular, the <em>Policy on the Management of Projects</em> which 
requires that: </p><ul><li>Departments undertake a standard assessment of their organizational project management capacity in conjunction with 
  their investment planning process. </li><li>All projects are to be assessed to determine their level of risk and complexity, before project initiation and expenditure 
  of funds.</li><li>Project approval limits are to be regularly reviewed, revised and approved by TB at least once every three years, 
  normally as part of the consideration of the department's investment plan. </li></ul><p>The following table outlines the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders: </p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="width95" summary="The following table outlines the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders"><tr><th scope="col"><p class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Entity</strong></p></th><th scope="col"><p class="alignCenter"><strong>Role / Responsibility</strong></p></th><th scope="col"><p class="alignCenter"><strong>Specific Functions</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p>Treasury Board of Canada</p></td><td class="alignTop"><ul><li>Treasury Board of Canada is a committee of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, and assumes its legal

existing assets and acquired services that are essential to program delivery. Departmental investment planning is a key 
element in achieving value for money and demonstrating sound stewardship.</p><p>To apply the requirements of the <em>Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</em>, it is important 
to understand the meaning of terms used within the policy and this and other associated guidance.</p><p><strong>Investment</strong>: the use of resources with the expectation of a future return of value (quantitative and 
qualitative), such as an increase in outputs, revenue or assets, or the acquisition of increased organizational capacity 
(knowledge, expertise or training). </p><p><strong>Acquired services</strong>: obtained through formal arrangements, such as Crown procurement contracts, memoranda 
of understanding and letters of agreement (between representatives of the Crown), to support internal or external clients 
or stakeholders in achieving specific outcomes. These services do not include arrangements for or in support of Grants 
and Contributions activities. </p><p>Acquired services are provided by individuals with significant training, qualifications and expertise in a professional, 
scientific, technical or managerial field. These services can be used to outsource certain operational functions (such as 
a call-centre support service), to provide training, or to provide knowledge and expertise not available in the organization.</p><p><strong>Assets </strong>are both tangible and intangible items of value with a future life beyond one year, whether they 
are Crown-owned, leased or accessed through other arrangements.</p><p>While assets can have a broader meaning in accounting terms, for the purpose of this policy, assets are only those considered 
to be long-term assets in the Government of Canada's financial statements that have a future life beyond one year (with 
the exception of prepaid expenses). Assets such as cash, receivables and prepaid expenses are not covered in this policy. 
Examples of assets include:</p><ul><li>Land</li><li>Buildings</li><li>Machinery and equipment</li><li>Works and infrastructure</li><li>Computer hardware</li><li>Computer software</li><li>Arms and weapons for defence</li><li>Motor vehicles</li><li>Military vehicles</li><li>Ships and boats</li><li>Aircraft</li></ul></section></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Investment Planning Process"><section anchor="2.1" title="2.1 Effective investment planning"><p>Investment planning is the process of allocating and reallocating limited resources, within departmental reference levels 
for both existing and new assets and acquired services, in a diligent and rational manner to support program outcomes and 
government priorities. When pursued effectively, investment planning is characterized as being:</p><ul><li>Essential to departmental operations and effective program delivery;</li><li>Responsive to government priorities and a dynamic operational environment; </li><li>Affordable, productive and financially sustainable; </li><li>Reflective of an appropriate balance of risk, benefits, and return between the Crown and third parties; </li><li>Consistent with relevant laws, regulations and policies, and codes of conduct; </li><li>Protective of Canadian heritage, the environment and in consideration of other relevant socio-economic factors; and</li><li>Reflective of departmental, portfolio, horizontal and government-wide perspectives while taking into account strategic 
  government-wide initiatives, as appropriate. </li></ul><p>Essentially, effective investment planning is a proactive approach to management, which better positions deputy heads 
to:</p><ul><li>Determine the best value for money of public investments; </li><li>Account for and demonstrate investment results; and</li><li>Allocate and reallocate resources in a manner which best contributes to the priorities of the department and the Government 
  of Canada.</li></ul><p>Effective investment planning is supported by the necessary systems and processes which integrate relevant planning information 
and determine priority investments across the department. These systems and processes should be evident in the plan by documenting:</p><ul><li>strategic investment priorities;</li><li>trends affecting investment decisions;</li><li>roles and responsibilities, including key points of accountability; </li><li>resource allocation and reallocation processes; </li><li>risk management strategies; </li><li>processes for integrating enabler functions (e.g. human resources, information technology, corporate services, etc.); </li><li>life-cycle management practices;</li><li>the control and monitoring regime; and</li><li>the performance management strategy.</li></ul><p>The plan should also clearly explain how these systems and processes support long-term investment decisions. </p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="2.2 Department-wide integrated planning"><p>Departmental investment planning should consider all departmental activities that contribute to the achievement of strategic 
objectives. These activities employ resources such as materiel, assets, systems, and people that are expected to produce 
short-term and intermediate results. Over time these results will contribute to outcomes and long-term objectives, such 
as improved government operations, enhanced program delivery and greater value for Canadians.</p><p>Effective integrated planning requires a coordinated effort and an established governance structure. If considering 
changes to existing governance, the department should examine the full range of available options to best meet their investment 
planning needs. For example, the deputy head may choose to establish a new investment planning working group based on existing 
committees, systems and processes in the department. However, whether creating new teams or working groups, or expanding 
the mandate of existing ones, the investment planning process should have a documented and approved governance structure 
in place which reflects representation from all functional areas of the department. It is also important that accountabilities 
and responsibilities be clear. These should include approval, oversight, monitoring and reporting requirements in relation 
to achieving investment and investment planning objectives.</p><p>A key component to meaningful and integrated investment planning is to engage the right people and areas of responsibility 
early in the planning process. This can be achieved by first identifying the planners and managers in all business lines 
within the department and then those areas which support their activities. Within a department, investment planning could 
include officials in the following areas<sup><strong><a href="#fn6" name="fnr6" title="See footnote 6">[6]</a></strong></sup>:</p><ul><li>Strategic/Corporate Plans and Priorities;</li><li>Procurement and Contract Management;</li><li>Project and Program Management;</li><li>Asset and Materiel Management (including lifecycle management);</li><li>Information and Information Technology Management;</li><li>Financial Management;</li><li>Human Resource Management;</li><li>Performance Management;</li><li>Risk Management;</li><li>Evaluation; and</li><li>Internal Audit.</li></ul><p>Effective investment planning should also include the engagement of relevant external stakeholders. The <em>Policy on 
Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</em> (Section 6.1.8) requires that departments keep stakeholders informed 
of planned investments. A department should first identify relevant stakeholders and then determine how to best keep them 
informed of planned investments on a regular basis. </p><p>Key federal stakeholders typically include, but are not limited to, central agencies, relevant socio-economic departments 
and common service providers. Among the socio-economic departments that should be considered as stakeholders are: Industry 
Canada, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, Western Economic 
Diversification Canada, Environment Canada, and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. Contracting authorities and common 
service organizations such as Public Works and Government Services Canada and Defence Construction Canada should also be 
considered in the department's stakeholder analysis. Federal stakeholders need to be informed of planned investments in 
an effort to improve investment planning across the broader Government of Canada (GC) enterprise and better achieve planned 
investment objectives. </p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. The Investment Plan"><section anchor="" title="3.1  An effective investment plan"><p>The investment plan should directly support a department's strategic plan (if there is one in place). The strategic 
plan is typically a high level document that outlines the department's long-term strategic direction and objectives, and 
articulates how these are aligned with the objectives and priorities of the Government of Canada.</p><p>The departmental investment plan should be one element of the department's overall management and reporting function. 
The investment plan should clearly align with and consider the following documents:</p><ul><li>Strategic objectives and priorities of the department and the GC;</li><li>Report on Plans and Priorities (RPP) and Departmental Performance Report (DPR);</li><li>Specific asset plans and associated strategies and/or policies and frameworks – for instance on real property, material 
  management, information technology, project management, etc; </li><li>Business/program plans - including plans for acquired services;</li><li>Organizational capacity - including project management capacity;</li><li>Project complexity and risk assessments; </li><li>Program Activity Architecture (PAA); and</li><li>Corporate Risk Profile.</li></ul><p>While the above documents would not be included in the investment plan, they should be used to support investment planning 
decisions and referenced in the plan as necessary.</p><p>The investment plan should provide a summary of the activities and long-term investments that the department plans to 
undertake, based on reference levels, which will best contribute to the achievement of the department's strategic objectives. 
These planned activities and investments will employ resources such as materiel, assets, systems, and people, and given 
limited resources, must be planned effectively over an extended period. When implementing these investment decisions, there 
are expected short-term and intermediate outputs which contribute to intermediate and long-term outcomes that should ultimately 
support strategic objectives such as improved government operations, enhanced program delivery, and greater value for Canadians.</p><p>An investment plan is expected to provide the deputy head with the relevant information needed to support strategic and 
operational decisions in consideration of key risks and appropriate mitigation strategies. The plan will further inform 
Treasury Board of key future investments within the Government of Canada and should include an understanding of:</p><ol><li>The <strong>departmental context:</strong> A high-level summary of the department's vision, strategic plans and priorities, 
briefly describing the department's current operational environment (including lessons learned from the most recent investment 
plan) and its future direction over the planning horizon. The financial reality of the department should also be included 
to provide a clear understanding of available resources over the planning period and what is detailed in the plan (e.g. 
excluding transfer payments);</li><li>The <strong>governance structure:</strong> A high-level description of the department's plan for investing in assets 
and acquired services which identifies relevant delegated authorities and decision-making processes to ensure appropriate 
integration and effective oversight. The investment planning process should also include steps to revise/update the investment 
planning governance and reporting structures (authorities, prioritization and decision-making processes, integration and 
oversight) based on relevant performance information.</li><li><strong>Investments</strong>: A detailed description of high-profile, complex and high risk investments should be 
included, as well as a summary of all other investments up to relevant reference levels. The affordability of the investment 
portfolio over the planning horizon is expected to be clear. This would include any relevant rationale as well as a description 
of the prioritization process. The <a href="/pm-gp/doc/pcra-ecrp/pcra-ecrp-eng.aspx">Project Complexity and Risk Assessment</a> (PCRA) levels would be used to support investment 
decisions on individual projects and guide a discussion with TBS as to which projects should be profiled in the investment 
plan. There should be a summary of projected resource requirements needed to support planned investments (both financial 
and human), including all relevant assumptions and procurement information<sup><strong><a href="#fn00" name="fnr00" title="See footnote **">[**]</a></strong></sup> over 
a minimum 5-year horizon. There should also be projected 5-year cost estimates<strong><sup><a href="#fn7" name="fnr7" title="See footnote 7">[7]</a></sup></strong> which 
include likely future conditions, impacts, and any life-cycle management considerations. </li><li><strong>Capacity management:</strong> This section should summarize the results of the departmental 
<a href="/pm-gp/doc/ompca-ecogp/ompca-ecogp-eng.aspx">Organizational 
Project Management Capacity Assessment</a> (OPMCA), and identify any capacity issues or considerations for managing investments 
in assets and acquired services including those in real property, materiel, information technology and fleet. The appropriateness 
of the capacity should be explained, within the context of the risk and complexity of planned projects. This section should 
also link to the resource requirements identified in the previous section; explain the financial and human resources capacity 
identifying any gaps and risks in meeting those requirements, as well as any plans to build capacity in these areas.</li><li><strong>Performance and risk management: </strong>A mechanism which demonstrates the relevance of the planning process 
is crucial to ensuring management practices are appropriate. The plan should provide an understanding of the performance 
management mechanisms which seek to ensure the effectiveness of the investment planning activities. This should include 
how lessons learned from previous investment planning cycles are applied to improve current processes and any future plans 
for enhancements. This section should also provide an overview of the risks to achieving the performance objectives of 
the investment plan and the effective management of investments in assets and acquired services. The relevant risk mitigation 
strategies should also be described.</li></ol><p>The investment plan is not a vehicle for Treasury Board (TB) approval of individual projects, contracts, real property 
transactions or any other activities cited or referred to in the plan. TB approval is sought of the management principles, 
processes and practices which led to the production of the departmental investment plan. The department must seek, through 
separate proposals in the submission, TB approval for other authorities such as the Organizational Project Management Capacity 
Assessment (OPMCA) class.</p></section><section anchor="3.2" title="3.2 Developing the investment plan"><p>It is important to note that the development of the investment plan should reflect the department's operational needs 
while keeping in mind the targeted audience – the deputy head and ministers. With that said, this section offers some guidance 
for considerations during the development of the departmental investment plan. These steps may vary by department, depending 
on the structure and the planning environment.</p><h4>3.2.1  Steps to consider</h4><p>The following are suggested steps to consider in the development of the investment plan (the order may vary by department). 
This guidance is intended to help determine what should be detailed in the investment plan and to develop an outline for 
the content of the planning document.</p><ol><li>Manage and define the development of a departmental investment plan as a project. The project should include milestones, 
deliverables and any deadlines with performance metrics to track progress and manage possible risks to achieving planned 
objectives and completing the plan according to the defined schedule.</li><li>Create cross-functional teams of planners, program and project managers with documented terms of reference, defined 
roles and responsibilities, lines of authority, decision-making points, risks/challenges, and performance expectations. 
This information could be formalized in a project charter.</li><li>Document relevant governance and reporting mechanisms (including delegated authorities, as well as decision-making, 
integration, prioritization, and oversight processes).</li><li>Review existing documents and data, such as:
  <ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Strategic plans;</li><li>Environmental scans;</li><li>Frameworks for the management of materiel, real property, information management (IM) and information technology (IT);</li><li>Asset management strategies;</li><li>Report on Plans and Priorities;</li><li>Business plans, including program, corporate, financial, human resources, IM and IT;</li><li>Project management frameworks.</li></ol></li><li>Create an outline of the plan (e.g., context, governance, investments, capacity, and risk and performance management). 
Refer to the Appendix – Content of Investment Plans, in the <em>Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</em>.</li><li>Identify and document key elements of departmental strategic objectives and priorities linking them to the asset plans 
and plans to acquire services (including relevant rationale and prioritization processes). Discern how investments have 
supported, and will continue to support, the achievement of these objectives and priorities. This process should be supported 
by relevant performance information. </li><li>Detail the high risk and complex investments (in both assets and acquired services) and summarize all other investments 
up to relevant departmental reference levels. This section of the plan should be linked to program activities and could 
be categorized by asset class for inventories and by service type for acquired services, but should reflect how the investment 
decisions are made (e.g. program area, branch, business line, etc.). Alternatively, it could be in sections by program 
activity related to the department's Program Activity Architecture including all planned investments in assets and acquired 
services with associated projects, Crown procurement contracts, or other transactions. How this is explained in the plan 
should reflect the operational reality within the department to facilitate the understanding of the deputy head, and TB 
Ministers. Either way, showing the link between planned investments and the program activities will strengthen the plan. 
This link could be achieved as simply as creating a table that lists planned investments by program activity.</li><li>Conduct an assessment to determine the Organizational Project Management Capacity<sup><strong><a href="#fn8" name="fnr8" title="See footnote 8">[8]</a></strong></sup> 
(OPMCA) class for the department and assess each individual project to determine its level of risk and complexity using 
the Project Complexity and Risk Assessment<sup><strong><a href="#fn9" name="fnr9" title="See footnote 9">[9]</a></strong></sup> (PCRA) tool. Together the results of these 
assessments should support investment planning decisions based on departmental priorities and in consideration of limited 
resources. </li><li>An analysis of available resources is key to integrated planning and to establishing the limits and parameters around 
the consideration of different investment options. It will inform prioritization and resource allocation decisions and 
will enable informed discussions around resource requirements to acquire, maintain, manage and dispose of proposed investments. 
This information will support the consideration of options to build or buy based on projected long-term cost estimates, 
likely future conditions, relevant risks, impacts, and life-cycle management issues.</li><li>Engage TBS in the review of early drafts of the plan, OPMCA and PCRAs and to prepare a submission to 
the Treasury Board seeking the requisite approvals.</li></ol><h4>3.2.2  Questions to be answered in the investment plan</h4><p>The following questions should be addressed in the Investment Plan: </p><p>Key Initiatives, Priorities and Strategies:</p><ol><li>What are the strategic objectives and priorities for the next five years?</li><li>What are the available investment options?</li><li>What enabling and resource factors need to be considered?</li><li>What horizontal objectives must be considered and factored into planned investments?</li><li>What government-wide objectives must be considered and factored into planned investments?</li><li>How do the planned investments link to program activities and outcomes?</li><li>What is to be considered a significant investment - high risk, complex, sensitive (publicly or politically)?</li><li>What is the anticipated procurement strategy for planned investments?<sup><strong><a href="#fn000" name="fnr000" title="See footnote ***">[***]</a></strong></sup></li></ol><p>Investment governance and decision-making mechanisms:</p><ol><li>What relevant governance structures are in place?</li><li>What investment planning processes are in place?</li><li>How are investment priorities determined and resources allocated?</li><li>How are investments approved and on what basis?</li><li>How are key stakeholders informed of planned investments?</li><li>How are the information systems to support investment planning integrated?</li><li>What investment planning control systems are in place?</li><li>How are these systems (of questions 4 and 5) monitored?</li><li>What evidence is there that the investment planning process supports good decision-making? How could it be improved?</li><li>What does an investment planning cycle include? How is it linked to strategic planning?</li></ol><p>Continuous improvement from previous investments and investment planning:</p><ol><li>Did previously planned investments achieve their intended outcomes?</li><li>How did the previous investment planning cycle meet defined outcomes?</li><li>What are the lessons learned from the previous investment plan?</li><li>How can the investment-planning framework be improved?</li><li>What are the challenges to, and opportunities for organizational investment planning and resourcing capacity (requirements 
  vs. capacity gaps)? How are these to be managed?</li></ol><h4>3.2.3 What to include in the investment plan</h4><p>The investment plan is a high-level document that should meet the planning and operational needs of the department, the 
Minister and Treasury Board. The investment plan, in providing an overview of the investment planning process and of the 
planned investments, should include certain information. Departments are to determine the best approach to presenting this 
information. An investment plan should include:</p><p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p><ul><li>A stand-alone brief of the investment plan.</li></ul><p><strong>Introduction/Departmental Context</strong></p><ul><li>Department's mandate.</li><li>Departmental Reference Levels (over next five years at a minimum) with the amounts detailed 
  by the plan highlighted. Should include a funding strategy and relevant assumptions.</li><li>Relevant historical data.</li><li>Grand total of all planned investments and other funding commitments over the short, 
  mid, long-term (cash forecast) to reflect reference levels.</li><li>Contribution of assets and acquired services to program outcomes.</li><li>High level profile of existing assets and acquired services in support of program activity.</li><li>Value of existing assets.</li><li>Evaluation of existing assets in terms of issues, risks, and opportunities, including an issue statement.</li></ul><p>Strategic objectives and priorities:</p><ul><li>Strategic objectives and priorities for the period covered by the plan.</li><li>The available investment options.</li><li>Any horizontal initiatives to consider related to the investment plan.</li><li>Any government-wide objectives of relevance to planned investments.</li><li>The links between planned investments, program activities and defined outcomes.</li></ul><p>Continuous improvement from the previous investment plan:</p><ul><li>Assess performance of previous planning cycle and current investments.</li><li>Identify lessons learned (gap analysis - the challenges to and opportunities for improving organizational planning and capacity).</li><li>Describe any improvements to the investment planning framework.</li></ul><p><strong>Governance, Planning, and Decision-making Structures</strong></p><p>Planning Framework:</p><ul><li>Describe the applicable governance structures in place.</li><li>Detail investment decision-making and approval processes to ensure clear accountability.</li><li>Describe the mechanism used to determine investment priorities and allocate and re-allocate resources.</li><li>Describe the process or processes used to inform key stakeholders of planned investments.</li><li>Explain how investment information is integrated (include description of systems used).</li><li>Describe how investment alternatives were considered, including opportunities for reallocation.</li></ul><p>Planning Cycle:</p><ul><li>Describe the investment planning cycle, include its frequency and outputs (i.e. updated investment plan, revised list 
  of investments, etc..).</li><li>Demonstrate how it is linked to strategic planning.</li><li>Demonstrate how it is integrated and considers the existing resource base and all other relevant information (e.g. 
  PCRA, Project Profile and Risk Assessment (PPRA), condition of existing asset base, etc.).</li></ul><p><strong>The Investments </strong></p><p>The section on investments should not include an exhaustive list of all planned investments. Rather it should provide 
a summary of low risk investments and should highlight details of the more significant investments identified as being complex, 
high risk, sensitive or extraordinary (investments that should be brought to the attention of the deputy head and TB Ministers).</p><ul><li>Summarize the investments in assets and acquired services planned over the next five years (at a minimum); include 
  a summary of current, ongoing investments, including projects, which are expected to comply with the requirements of the

a minimum 5-year horizon and incorporate a minimum 3-year update to Treasury Board Secretariat, and /or the Treasury Board.</p><p>Mechanisms should be built into the planning processes to ensure that new developments and their relevant impacts are 
considered on a regular basis and the investment plan is adjusted and updated accordingly. Any significant variations, 
such as changes to the organizational project management capacity, the departmental reference levels or funding strategy, 
the governance and decision-making process for investments or perhaps environmental considerations that increase risks for 
the department, should be discussed with program sector at TBS. TBS will determine whether and how a revised departmental 
investment plan is to be brought forward to TB for approval.</p><p>Keeping TBS informed of all changes is seen as the best way to ensure any significant changes are appropriately communicated 
to TB Ministers.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Investment Performance and Risk Management"><p>It is important to ensure that planned investments and the relevant governance and oversight perform as envisioned. The 
plan should describe the performance management strategy and systems supporting planned investments and demonstrate how 
performance monitoring supports the continuous improvement of investment planning activities. </p><p>Measuring performance is a sound management practice and will help demonstrate whether the investment planning cycle 
achieved defined objectives, while identifying any gaps and opportunities for improvement. Performance results, project 
close-out reports and other lessons learned should also be documented and considered in future investment planning cycles.</p><p>Regular reviews within each fiscal year should be conducted to monitor progress of investment activities towards the 
objectives identified in the investment plan. Variances may occur if and when new pressures arise, priorities change, or 
initiatives do not develop as planned, at which time it may be necessary to update the investment plan to reflect these 
changes. However, as previously stated, it is important to document the variances, the supporting rationale any corrective 
action taken, and how this will impact future investment planning decisions.</p><p>The investment planning performance management system should be aligned with the performance measures outlined in the 
Management, Resources, and Results Structure Policy<strong><sup><a href="#fn13" name="fnr13" title="See footnote 13">[13]</a></sup></strong>, the supporting Program Activity 
Architecture (PAA) and defined strategic outcomes. The planned investment activities should be aligned with the departmental 
Report on Plans and Priorities (RPP) and therefore the actual performance and results of the investment activities should 
support the Departmental Performance Report (DPR).</p><section anchor="4.1" title="4.1  Performance Management"><p>Performance management is the link between the plan and the planning process. Measuring performance helps determine 
whether the investment planning process resulted in the right plan and whether the plan effectively supported the achievement 
of expected results. Lessons learned from performance results should be taken into consideration to improve future investment 
planning cycles, which should in turn result in improved planning decisions and better plans.</p><p>Within the context of the <em>Policy on Investment Planning - Assets and Acquired Services</em>, it is a requirement for 
departments to evaluate, monitor and document the investment planning process and its results.</p><p>Specifically, section 6.2 of the policy states:</p><ul><li>Performance relative to the obligations under this policy is measured and documented.</li><li>The effectiveness of the investment-planning regime is reviewed on an ongoing basis, consistent with the 
  department's risk-based audit planning.</li><li>The implementation of departmental investment plans, approval of investments and resourcing decisions is 
  monitored.</li></ul><p>Performance management of the investment planning process is expected to identify opportunities for improvement in:</p><ol><li>Investment planning activities;</li><li>Governance of investment management;</li><li>Investment management capacity (people, financial and systems); and</li><li>Investment performance and risk management;</li></ol><p>In general, a department should consider the long, intermediate and short term objectives in the above four areas and:</p><ol><li>Develop one or two key indicators for each, to measure performance;</li><li>Identify and assess risks to achieving defined performance objectives;</li><li>Develop appropriate monitoring and risk mitigation strategies;</li><li>Implement these strategies as required. </li></ol><p>The following is a sample template of a performance measurement table:</p><p><strong>Investment Planning</strong></p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="widthFull" summary="The following is a sample template of a performance measurement table"><tr><td><p class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Category</strong></p></td><td><p class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Outcome</strong></p></td><td><p class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Activities/ Outputs</strong></p></td><td><p class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Indicator/ Target/ Milestone</strong></p></td><td><p class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Measure</strong></p></td><td class="alignTop"><p><strong>Risks</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p><strong>Investment Planning</strong></p></td><td class="alignTop"><p>Clear and effective departmental investment plan</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" class="alignTop"><p><strong>Governance</strong></p></td><td class="alignTop"><p>Clear and effective governance structure</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p>Clear and transparent accountability</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" class="alignTop"><p><strong>Processes</strong></p></td><td class="alignTop"><p>Efficient and effective investment planning processes</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p>Prioritization of investments </p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p>Well-supported, timely and documented investment decisions</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" class="alignTop"><p><strong>Capacity</strong></p></td><td class="alignTop"><p>Sufficient financial resources for investment management</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p>Right HR resources at the right time for investment management </p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p><strong>Results</strong></p></td><td class="alignTop"><p>Performance metrics/ assessments/reviews/etc. of investment management</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong></p></td><td class="alignTop"><p>Results and gap analysis feed into future planning where corrections are made when necessary</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr></table><h4>4.1.1 Evaluating the planning process<sup><a href="#fn14" name="fnr14" title="See footnote 14"><strong>[14]</strong></a></sup></h4><p>An evaluation of the investment planning process should be linked to its key objectives and outcomes and should at a 
minimum consider the following questions:</p><ol><li>Is there a clearly articulated investment planning governance structure?</li><li>Are there ongoing assessments and reviews of the investment planning governance structure (identifying the challenges 
  and opportunities for improvement)?</li><li>Is there transparency in governance, accountability and responsibility for investment planning and the management 
  of investments?</li><li>Is the planning process straightforward and clear or is it confusing and difficult?</li><li>Does the process adequately support investment planning in that it provides the right information (top investment 
  priorities across the department aligned with strategic objectives and program delivery in consideration of available

  or not participating?</li><li>Are the information systems in place adequate (are they integrated across the department, do they support planning, 
  budgeting and accounting for resource allocations)?</li><li>Do the systems support performance measurement and reporting related to the integrated management of departmental 
  investments?</li><li>Are mechanisms in place to ensure TBS is advised in a timely manner of deviations from and significant changes to 
  the plan?</li><li>What is the level of capacity for investment planning and management and is it capable of effectively planning and

  continuous improvement towards realistic and accurate plans?</li><li>Was the plan effectively implemented? What evidence is there that the plan was effectively implemented?</li></ol><h4>4.1.2 Evaluating the investment plan</h4><p>An evaluation of the investment plan should consider the following questions:</p><ol><li>Does the investment plan clearly support the strategic objectives and priorities and the program outcomes of the department?</li><li>Does the plan identify the key issues likely facing the department on the horizon?</li><li>Is the plan succinct and clear?</li><li>Does the plan contain key investment information highlighting those investments that are high risk and complex?</li><li>Does it provide an accurate picture of the department's planned investments over at least a 5-year time frame?</li><li>Does the plan capture investment information on both assets and acquired services?</li><li>Does the plan effectively explain the governance, planning, and decision-making structures?</li><li>Does the plan consider the department's investment management resource and capacity levels?</li><li>Are the investment risks sufficiently defined, assessed, and managed? </li><li>Does the planning cycle include a process for managing investment performance management process?</li><li>Do investment activities reflect the plan? If not, why not?</li><li>Are lessons learned from previous investment planning cycles applied to improve current processes and 
  future plans, and are they reflected in the plan?</li><li>Does the plan reference the organizational project management capacity assessment and express the appropriateness 
  of the capacity in light of the risk and complexity of projects? </li></ol></section><section anchor="4.2" title="4.2 Monitoring and Reporting"><p>The department will need to provide evidence to demonstrate to TBS that the investment planning policy's specific monitoring 
and reporting requirements are being met, which include:</p><ul><li>Measuring and documenting the performance of investment planning and investments.</li><li>Reviewing the effectiveness of the investment planning and decision-making structure (process, accountabilities,
