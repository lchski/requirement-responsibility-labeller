Effective date"><p>The present document becomes effective January 1, 1999 and replaces the version dated January 1, 1998.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Policy objectives"><p>To encourage federal organizations to hire students in order to develop a pool of qualified candidates for future Public Service appointments.</p><p>To provide employment opportunities for Canadian students that will:</p><ul><li>enrich their academic programs;</li><li>help fund their education and encourage them to complete their studies;</li><li>develop their employability skills and improve their ability to find good jobs after graduation;</li><li>offer insights into future employment opportunities; and</li><li>help them evaluate their career options within the federal Public Service.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Policy statement"><p>The federal Public Service is committed to offering students valuable learning assignments that represent structured pathways from a school environment to the world of work. While students are not to be regarded as lower-cost alternatives to regular employees, they are recognized as trainees and do not receive the same benefits as full-fledged employees.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Application"><p>This policy applies to departments and agencies listed in Schedule I, Part I of the 
            <em>Public Service Staff Relations Act</em>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Policy requirements"><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 Eligibility"><p>To be eligible for assignment under one of the student employment programs, a candidate must meet the criteria defined in Appendix A.</p><p>The federal Public Service supports learning assignments for non-Canadian post-secondary students who are legally entitled to work in Canada, when reciprocal arrangements exist for an equivalent number of Canadian students studying in foreign countries. International students, however, are not to displace Canadian students. The work experience of international students is
                limited to the equivalent of 12 months of full-time work.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Departmental responsibilities"><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Deputy heads or their delegates must: 
                    <ol class="lower-roman"><li>identify appropriate learning assignments and create a working environment that will allow students to help the organization meet its operational needs while developing and enhancing their employability skills;</li><li>ensure that all students employed in the department are either on assignment under one of the programs described in 
                        <em>Student Employment Programs in the Federal Government</em>or appointed to a classified position; and</li><li>determine the departmental compensation strategy in accordance with the present policy and the 
                        <em>Terms and Conditions of Employment for</em>Students, or obtain prior approval from the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat to compensate students differently. This strategy will either establish departmental practices or authorize delegated managers to determine pay rates on a case by case basis.</li></ol></li><li>For each assignment, managers must: 
                    <ol class="lower-roman"><li>develop a structured learning plan, defining what the student should accomplish (see Appendices B and C for model learning plans) or use the generic plan provided by the academic institution combined with a description of the specific assignment;</li><li>assess the progress of each student at the end of the assignment; and</li><li>compensate students in accordance with the departmental compensation strategy.</li></ol></li></ol></section><section anchor="5.3" title="5.3 Compensation plan"><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Compensation must not differ for students from co-operative and non-co-operative programs. Student salary ranges are based on academic levels and all pay rates are proportional to the rates graduates would earn if recruited to the federal Public Service.</li><li>Students are not to be regarded as lower-cost alternatives to regular employees. Instead, managers must ensure that, as they employ students to get work done, they also improve students' potential for future gainful employment by developing their employability skills. This is the trade-off they are asked to assume in meeting operational needs at a lower compensation cost
                    than that generated by regular employees.</li><li>Student rates are not directly related to the work performed, whereas classified rates are. Therefore, managers wishing to assign students a full set of classified duties should instead appoint them to a classified position through the regular staffing process, and pay them at the classified rate.</li><li>Pay rates and other conditions of employment are specified in the 
                    <em>Terms and Conditions of Employment for Students</em>. For all other situations, compensation shall match that for employees appointed for specified periods of less than three months.</li></ol></section><section anchor="5.4" title="5.4 Non-paid assignments"><p>The federal Public Service is a signatory to the 
                <em>Conference Board of Canada's Ethical Guidelines for Business Education Partnerships</em>. In keeping with the spirit of these guidelines, managers are not to use free student labour, except when academic credit programs, primarily the Secondary School Co-op Education Program, preclude payment of a salary, allowance, stipend or honorarium.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Responsibilities"><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat will provide guidance to departments, consistent with its role as corporate employer, to ensure that the federal Public Service meets its commitment to students. Therefore, the Secretary of the Treasury Board, or his or her delegate, is authorized to develop and implement certain management practices, which include: 
                <ul><li>making amendments to the 
                    <em>Terms and Conditions of Employment for Students</em>, consistent with the objectives and guiding principles of this policy;</li><li>making exceptions to the 
                    <em>Terms and Conditions of Employment for Students</em>, consistent with the objectives and guiding principles of this policy, when operational circumstances make it necessary to do so;</li><li>disseminating best practices for departmental use;</li><li>establishing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Public Service Commission of Canada that outlines responsibilities, conditions and accountability criteria; and</li><li>representing the federal Public Service in gatherings that address student and education-related matters that concern employers.</li></ul></li><li>Under the 
                <em>Public Service Employment Act</em>(PSEA), the Public Service Commission of Canada is responsible for the recruitment and referral, including re-employment, of all candidates for student employment programs designated by the Treasury Board, unless indicated otherwise in the program description. Under the PSEA, the Public Service Commission of Canada may delegate some or all of
                this responsibility to departments.</li><li>Public Works and Government Services Canada develops and maintains the salary administration systems for the various programs.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Monitoring"><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat will monitor departmental performance by: 
                <ul><li>regularly collecting departmental salary administration data directly from the compensation system;</li><li>periodically reviewing departmental application of the policy; and</li><li>reviewing audit and evaluation reports on the application of the policy.</li></ul></li><li>The Public Service Commission of Canada conducts monitoring and audit activities it deems necessary to ensure conformity with this policy and with the 
                <em>Student Employment Programs Exclusion Approval Order</em>.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="8. References"><section anchor="8.1" title="8.1 Authority"><p>This policy is issued pursuant to the

The academic level thus differs from the year of academic study (e.g. academic year 1, academic year 2).</dd><dt><strong>Employability skills</strong> (<em>compétences relatives à l'employabilité</em>)</dt><dd>The Conference Board of Canada defines these as the generic skills, attitudes and behaviours required of the Canadian workforce. They are developed in school and through a variety of life experiences outside school, such as work assignments. These skills include: 
                <ul><li>academic skills (the ability to communicate, think and learn);</li><li>personal management skills (positive attitudes and behaviours, a sense of responsibility and adaptability in the workplace); and</li><li>teamwork skills (the ability to work with others).</li></ul></dd><dt><strong>Entitled to work in Canada</strong> (<em>Droit de travailler au Canada</em>)</dt><dd>Canadian students and non-Canadian students with a Canadian employment authorization are entitled to work in Canada.</dd><dt><strong>Student</strong> (<em>étudiant</em>)</dt><dd>To be considered for employment by the federal government under one of the student employment programs, a person must be: 
                <ul><li>registered as a full-time secondary or post-secondary student in an accredited institution;</li><li>currently recognized as having full-time status by the academic institution; and</li><li>returning to full-time studies in the next academic term.</li></ul><p>Students who are in their final year of academic study and who are not intending to return to full-time studies are eligible to work part-time up until the time they graduate. Managers must ensure that students hired in their final year are not employed under a student employment program beyond their graduation date.</p><p>There are two variants:</p><ul><li>students with full-time status classified by their educational institution as having physical and/or emotional disabilities; and</li><li>adult students participating in education and retraining programs at the secondary level, operated under the authority of a school administration.</li></ul><p>Students in these latter categories, though not full-time students, are eligible for student employment programs under this policy and, where an appropriate match exists, their placement is encouraged.</p></dd></dl></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B - Model for learning plan (high-school
