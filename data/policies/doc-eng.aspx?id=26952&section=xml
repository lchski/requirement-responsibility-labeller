This subprocess group involves detailed travel planning in accordance with the appropriate policy instruments. Blanket travel authority may be requested or provided, typically at
    the start of the fiscal year. When the travel event is approaching, the person travelling completes the travel authorization and advance request, and ensures it is in accordance with the applicable policies. The travel request is approved by the individual with the appropriate expenditure initiation authority. This subprocess group also involves ensuring that there is a sufficient unencumbered
    balance, and includes creating and updating commitments prior to approving or amending travel requests and/or blanket travel authorities pursuant to section 32 of the FAA. The manager is accountable for managing his or her commitments in accordance with department-specific policy.</p><p>If a travel advance is requested, it is submitted to the manager for section 34 certification through the Manage Travel Administration and Travel Claims subprocess group and then sent to financial services for payment processing through the Manage Settlement of Travel Claims subprocess group.</p><p><strong>Manage Travel Administration and Travel Claims</strong> involves obtaining a Travel Authorization Number (TAN), if required; making travel arrangements in accordance with the approved travel request and the applicable policy instruments; and handling requests for travel advances or travel claims by completing account verification and providing certification authority pursuant to
    section 34 of the FAA. Once travel has occurred and/or expenses have been incurred, the person travelling completes a travel claim and submits the claim with the required supporting documentation to the appropriate manager for approval. When the travel claim is received, the responsibility centre manager completes account verification and exercises section 34 certification authority; then a
    request for payment is made and sent to financial services.</p><p><strong>Manage Settlement of Travel Claims</strong> ends the Manage Travel business process and involves performing quality assurance activities, where applicable; exercising payment authorization pursuant to section 33 of the FAA; completing and submitting payment requisitions; and finalizing payments. When quality assurance is not performed, the process proceeds to Manage Post-Payment
    Verification (Business Process 8.1). When quality assurance is performed, the process proceeds to Manage Financial Close (Business Process 8.2). Financial services is responsible for managing payment requisitions, certifying payments (section 33 of the FAA), and recording payments. The Receiver General for Canada through the Banking and Cash Management Sector of the Department of Public Works and
    Government Services is responsible for issuing payments.</p><p>Throughout the Manage Travel business process, there are specific times when the vendor master data file needs to be updated. The connection point to Manage Vendor Master Data File (Business Process 7.1) is provided in Manage Travel Claims and Advance Requests (Subprocess 3.2.7).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="1" title="1.

Context"><p>This guideline is part of a set of guidelines designed to assist departments<sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3" name="ftnref3"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[3]</a></sup> in implementing common financial management business processes. This guideline supports the <em>Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</em> and the <em>Directive on the Stewardship of
    Financial Management Systems</em>.</p><p>This guideline presents the “should be” model for Manage Travel, describing roles, responsibilities and recommended activities from a financial management perspective. Most activities are financial in nature, but some non-financial activities are included in order to provide a comprehensive process description; these activities are identified as outside the scope of Manage Travel.
    The recommended activities comply with the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, other legislation, and Government of Canada policy instruments.</p><p>Recognizing that deputy heads are ultimately responsible for all aspects of financial management systems within their department, standardizing and streamlining financial management system configurations, business processes and data across government provides significant direct and indirect benefits relative to the quality of financial management in the Government of Canada. By establishing a
    common set of rules, standardization reduces the multitude of different systems, business processes and data that undermine the quality and cost of decision-making information. As government-wide standardization increases, efficiency, integrity and interoperability are improved.<sup><a href="#ftn4" id="ftnref4" name="ftnref4"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[4]</a></sup></p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3.

Manage Travel Plans (Subprocess 3.2.1) – Level 3 Process Flow</a></p></div><h5>5.2.1.1 Activities</h5><p>The Manage Travel business process begins with the department's approved budget from Manage Planning and Budgeting (Business Process 1.1), including the annual budget for travel approved by the deputy head.<sup><a href="#ftn19" id="ftnref19" name="ftnref19"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[19]</a></sup> From here, detailed travel planning occurs by responsibility centre
        managers throughout the department. It is at this point that the requirement for blanket travel authorities is considered and that action is taken.</p><p>An important step before finalizing a travel plan is determining which policy authority applies and which policy instruments are relevant (Activity 3.2.1.1 – Determine Appropriate Policy Authority) to establish the correct travel provisions. The primary policy instruments include:</p><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=19855">Directive on the Management of Expenditures on Travel, Hospitality and Conferences</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15783">Directive on Travel Cards and Travellers Cheques</a></em></li><li><em><a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/index.php?did=10&amp;lang=eng">National Joint Council Travel Directive</a></em></li><li>Organization-specific travel policies</li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13607">Policies for Ministers' Offices</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12135">Special Travel Authorities</a></em></li><li><em><a href="http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;page=information&amp;sub=publications&amp;doc=terms-conditions/2009-eng.htm">Terms and Conditions of Employment for Full-Time Governor in Council Appointees</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=22313">Travel Approval Guidelines for Deputy Ministers and Heads of Agencies, Boards and Commissions (Deputy Heads)</a></em> (November 2010)</li><li><em>Treasury Board Supplementary Travel Policy</em> (for the Executive Group and excluded employees)</li></ul><p>It is important to note that more than one policy may apply. For example, the standards and conditions governing travel on government business for full-time Governor in Council appointees are prescribed in the <em>National Joint Council Travel Directive</em> and Treasury Board's <em>Special Travel Authorities</em>. In addition, further instructions could be provided in Orders in Council from
        the <a href="http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/">Privy Council Office</a>.</p><p>How and when the policy instruments apply will depend on the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Employee or traveller</strong>: Travel provisions differ based on whether the person travelling is considered an “employee” or a “traveller.” For example, as per the <em>National Joint Council Travel Directive</em>, employees (persons employed in the public service) are allowed dependant care expenses or home provisions for weekend travel, while travellers
            (persons authorized to travel on federal government business) are not.</li><li><strong>Employee category, group, and level</strong>: Some employees may be members of the Executive Group or may be excluded employees (i.e., excluded from a bargaining unit for managerial or confidential reasons); for these employees, the <em>Treasury Board Supplementary Travel Policy</em> (for the Executive Group and excluded employees) apply. For represented employees, policy
            instruments should be read in conjunction with the relevant collective agreements.</li><li><strong>Enabling legislation</strong>: An enabling legislation or Act may confer certain authorities to the Treasury Board or to departments and agencies to develop or propose a distinct travel policy, e.g., for Agents of Parliament, the Canada Revenue Agency, the Canadian Forces, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. These organizations may refer to existing policy instruments as a
            benchmark in developing their own travel policy.</li><li><strong>Cabinet direction</strong>: The Cabinet or budget direction for the Government of Canada may impose overarching limitations on travel, such as on the amount of travel or on certain entitlements.</li></ul><p>Once the policy instruments are clearly determined, detailed travel plans are developed (Activity 3.2.1.2 – Define Detailed Travel Plans). Several considerations should be taken into account when planning travel,<sup><a href="#ftn20" id="ftnref20" name="ftnref20"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[20]</a></sup> such as the following:</p><ul><li>Travel costs should be avoided whenever there is a reasonable and more economical alternative available and deemed sufficient to meet the intended objective (e.g., use of government facilities, tele/videoconferencing);</li><li>Booking transportation, accommodations, and conference facilities is expected to take place well in advance to obtain optimal discounted rates, where possible;</li><li>The number of persons sent to the same event or activities, including conferences, should be kept to the minimum necessary for the effective conduct of government business, leveraging where possible individuals already located near the event or site; and</li><li>In situations of periodic or multiple trips to the same destination or where several persons are sent to the same events or activities, including conferences, costs are to be minimized through effective planning and coordination.</li></ul><p>Detailed travel planning includes an assessment of recurring travel arrangements to ensure their continued relevance to the department. It is also important to ensure that planned trip costs are minimized by considering alternatives to travel (e.g., teleconferencing), reducing the duration or extent of the trip, making early bookings to obtain discounts, and ensuring value for money when
        determining the location and number of attendees.<sup><a href="#ftn21" id="ftnref21" name="ftnref21"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[21]</a></sup></p><p>As part of travel planning and managing travel within a department, consideration should be given to the specific arrangement of group travel because this may provide efficiencies and reductions in costs. Consideration should also be given to the use of available credits. Various suppliers give credits for unused travel, and certain airlines allow such credits to be transferred within

        FAA. Once travel has occurred and/or expenses have been incurred, the person travelling completes a travel claim and submits the claim with the appropriate supporting documentation for approval to the appropriate manager. When the travel claim is received, the responsibility centre manager completes account verification and exercises section 34 certification authority; then a request for payment

        incurred, the person travelling completes a travel claim and submits the claim with the supporting documentation to the manager for approval.

A TAN is a unique number allocated to each authorized trip.<sup><a href="#ftn39" id="ftnref39" name="ftnref39"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[39]</a></sup> TANs
        are required when making travel arrangements through Government of Canada Shared Travel Services. They are issued by the departmental TAN holder(s), who have the option of using online TANs, if the department has implemented the Expense Management Tool, or offline TANs, which is a paper-based process.<sup><a href="#ftn40" id="ftnref40" name="ftnref40"><span class="cn-invisible">See footnote </span>[40]</a></sup> In some cases, the issuance of TANs within the department is automated. If a TAN is issued for non-employee travel, appropriate controls are needed, such as having departmental personnel make the travel arrangements (Activity 3.2.6.1 – Obtain Travel Authorization Number). Departments are responsible for maintaining and ensuring the integrity of the TANs.</p><p>Once the TAN is obtained, the person travelling can make the necessary travel arrangements using their user identification code (Activity 3.2.6.2 – Make Travel Arrangements in Accordance With Authorization). The user identification code is associated with the user's profile, which includes information such as contact information, emergency contact information, and travel preferences. The
        person travelling is responsible for keeping his or her profile up to date. Use of the travel card is encouraged to access relevant insurance coverage and to facilitate the creation of the expense report in the Expense Management Tool via an automated data feed (for departments that have implemented this optional tool). Employees on government travel shall utilize government-approved suppliers,
        services and products, when these are available. Where access to these suppliers, services, and products requires the use of an individual designated travel card, the provision and use of the individual designated travel card requires the employee's agreement.<sup><a href="#ftn41" id="ftnref41" name="ftnref41"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[41]</a></sup> The use of the travel
        card is mandatory for the Executive Group and excluded employees. Travel arrangements are expected to take place well in advance of travel in order to obtain optimal discounted rates, where possible. When choosing the mode of transportation, the most economical option available is selected, taking into account cost, duration, safety, and practicality, respecting the principles of the <em>National
        Joint Council Travel Directive.</em><sup><a href="#ftn42" id="ftnref42" name="ftnref42"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[42]</a></sup> Transaction authority is exercised when travel arrangements are made and the person travelling enters into a contract with the service provider.</p><p>When making travel arrangements, the person travelling needs to consider the following:</p><ul><li>Travel arrangements are within the travel authorization (including the blanket travel authority) and comply with policy provisions;</li><li>Available airline credits are used, to the extent possible;</li><li>Travel arrangements are booked online to take advantage of lower transaction fees;</li><li>For group travel, consideration is given to additional discounts, group rates and/or travel efficiencies;</li><li>Proper allowance entitlements are used as described in the <em><a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/index.php?sid=91&amp;hl=1&amp;lang=eng#tc-tm_6">National Joint Council Travel Directive</a></em>, <em>including:</em><ul><li><a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/index.php?sid=97&amp;lang=eng">Appendix B—Kilometric Rates - Modules 1, 2 and 3</a>;</li><li><a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/index.php?sid=98&amp;lang=eng">Appendix C—Allowances - Module 1, 2 and 3</a>; and</li><li><a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/app_d.php?lang=eng">Appendix D—Allowances - Module 4</a>; and</li></ul></li><li>Other relevant policy instruments have been considered.</li></ul><p>Once travel has occurred and/or expenses have been incurred, the person travelling prepares and attests a travel claim, ensuring that all prepaid portions are included (e.g., travel advances and amounts paid through the departmental travel expense card, such as air fare) (Activity 3.2.6.3 – Prepare and Attest Travel Claim). Sometimes travel may be cancelled, i.e., it does not occur,
        while expenses such as non-refundable deposits or reservation fees have still been incurred. In such cases, preparing and attesting a travel claim is required in order to be reimbursed for these expenses. The output of this subprocess is a travel claim that includes supporting documentation and attestation by the person travelling.</p><p>If travel arrangements were paid through the departmental travel expense card or account, refer to the periodic payment category in Manage Other Payments (Business Process 3.3) for a description of the process for paying the travel card statement. It is important to ensure that the portion that was paid using the departmental travel expense card or account is included in the travel claim.</p><p>If no travel has occurred and no expenses have been incurred, the manager proceeds to Manage Commitment (Subprocess 3.2.5) to close out the commitment. In situations where travel has not occurred and an employee has obtained a travel advance, it is necessary to recover the funds. It is good practice to monitor outstanding travel advances to ensure that they are applied to the appropriate
        travel claim or that action is taken to recover the funds. The recovery of funds is described in Manage Revenues, Receivables and Receipts (Business Process 2.1). If the travel advance was obtained through a travel card, the employee will need to ensure that the travel card balance is settled.</p><h5>5.3.1.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>The person travelling is responsible for obtaining a TAN, making travel arrangements and preparing the travel claim. In some cases, the responsibility centre manager may choose to obtain the TAN and make the travel arrangements on behalf of a traveller, when the traveller is not an employee.</p><p>Two potential scenarios exist:</p><ul><li>In scenario 1, the employee is responsible and accountable for obtaining a TAN and making travel arrangements.</li><li>In scenario 2, the traveller is responsible and accountable, however, the responsibility centre manager may perform certain activities on behalf of the traveller, such as obtaining a TAN and making travel arrangements.

The request for payment includes the claim data, payment details (e.g., date the claim was received, due date, amount of claim, etc.), vendor data, the payment type (i.e., regular or priority payment), and the financial coding block. With respect to interest on
        payments to employees (e.g., travel claim reimbursements), the standard 30-day payment term does not apply because employees are expected to be paid as soon as possible;<sup><a href="#ftn50" id="ftnref50" name="ftnref50"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[50]</a></sup> therefore, no calculation of interest is required.</p><p>As part of this subprocess, the financial officer with delegated authority for section 33 of the FAA performs quality assurance (Activity 3.2.8.2 – Perform Quality Assurance). The financial officer exercises payment authority and is responsible for certifying and ensuring the following:<sup><a href="#ftn51" id="ftnref51" name="ftnref51"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[51]</a></sup></p><ul><li>There is auditable evidence demonstrating that account verification has taken place and has been certified by an individual with delegated financial signing authority pursuant to section 34 of the FAA;</li><li>No payment is made when the payment:

Manage Post-Payment Verification (Business Process 8.1) describes the quality assurance requirements of section 33 of the FAA for sampling of medium- and low-risk transactions. Furthermore, the financial officer is responsible for requesting corrective action when a critical error is
        identified during the quality assurance process for payment authority.<sup><a href="#ftn53" id="ftnref53" name="ftnref53"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[53]</a></sup></p><p>The next step is to determine whether there is a recovery (remittance). A recovery is needed when the travel advance that was issued is higher than the travel claim, or in any situation where an employee is indebted to the Crown. In these cases, no claim is reimbursed to the employee, and funds are recovered through Manage Revenue, Receivables and Receipts (Business Process 2.1).</p><p>In addition, Section 6.2.2 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060&amp;section=text#sec6.2"><em>Directive on Delegation of Financial Authorities for Disbursements</em></a> requires that persons with delegated authority for section 33 of the FAA not exercise the following:</p><ul><li>Certification authority and payment authority on the same payment; and</li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060">Spending</a>, <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060">certification</a>, or <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060">payment</a> authority for an expenditure from which they can directly or indirectly benefit (e.g., when the payee is the individual with financial signing authority or when the expenditure is incurred for the benefit of that individual).</li></ul><p>Once the financial officer is satisfied that all the requirements have been met, the payment requisition is certified for section 33 of the FAA, and electronic authorization and authentication (EAA) is performed (Activity 3.2.8.3 – Exercise FAA, Section 33 Certification (Including EAA Key)).</p><p>The payment requisition is then prepared and submitted to the Receiver General (Activity 3.2.8.4 – Submit Payment Requisition to Receiver General) in accordance with the:</p><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15784">Directive on Payment Requisitioning and Cheque Control</a></em>;</li><li><em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-130/index.html">Payments and Settlements Requisitioning Regulations, 1997</a></em>; and</li><li><em><a href="http://publiservice.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/rg/manuels-manuals/chap4/index-eng.html">Receiver General Manual</a></em>, Chapter 4 “Standard Payment System and Departments.”</li></ul><p>The requisitions within the payment file contain full payment details: name, date, amount, delivery address, financial institution routing information, stub details (if required), and the type of payment.

The manager then submits the travel card request form to the departmental travel card coordinator for approval (Activity 3.2.10.2 – Provide Recommendation for Approval). If the manager does not provide the recommendation for approval, then the
        process to obtain a travel card ends, and no travel card is issued.</p><p>The departmental travel card coordinator receives the completed travel card request form from the responsibility centre manager and authorizes issuance of the travel card to the employee along with the credit limits and the cash withdrawal limits (Activity 3.2.10.3 – Provide Authorization). Before proceeding with authorization, the departmental travel card coordinator must perform the
        following, as applicable:<sup><a href="#ftn117" id="ftnref117" name="ftnref117"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[117]</a></sup></p><ul><li>Consult with the departmental travel card coordinator in the former department of recently transferred individuals to determine whether the cardholder's previous individual designated travel card was cancelled due to payment delinquency;</li><li>Determine whether the individual has lost the privilege of using an individual designated travel card by failing to pay his or her account in the past; and</li><li>Determine the circumstances that led to the cancellation of a previously issued individual designated travel card and assess whether those circumstances have changed.</li></ul><p>If the departmental travel card coordinator does not authorize the request to obtain a travel card, then the process ends.</p><p>Once the departmental travel card coordinator has authorized the travel card request, the travel card provider will process the application and send the travel card to the departmental travel card coordinator. The employee must complete and sign a written acknowledgement of responsibilities and obligations before receiving the initial travel card from the departmental travel card coordinator

The cardholder ensures that card statements are settled promptly so that the outstanding balance does not become a delinquent account.<sup><a href="#ftn119" id="ftnref119" name="ftnref119"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[119]</a></sup></p><p>The use of the travel card may be centrally monitored by independent departmental staff in accordance with their department's tolerance for risk of error or misuse (Activity 3.2.10.5 – Monitor Use of Travel Card). The cardholder is responsible for monitoring all charges made and ensuring that the travel card is used only to pay for authorized government travel expenses. The cardholder is
        responsible for notifying the departmental travel coordinator and card issuer of any incorrect or unauthorized charges as soon as they are noted to ensure that the cardholder or department is not held responsible for paying the charges.<sup><a href="#ftn120" id="ftnref120" name="ftnref120"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[120]</a></sup> The cardholder may choose to notify the

Continued inappropriate use is grounds for withdrawing the card. If an individual designated travel card account becomes 90 days past due, the card is automatically suspended by the card issuer, and the department is then
        responsible to pay the account balance, in full, within 30 days. The department is responsible for recovering the amounts paid from the employee, usually through a set-off against salary or wages.<sup><a href="#ftn121" id="ftnref121" name="ftnref121"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[121]</a></sup></p><p>In instances where there are delinquencies and the department settles the account with the card provider (Activity 3.2.10.6 – Pay Delinquent Card), the department recovers the funds from the employee. This is described in the Manage Collections (Business Process 2.3). When the cardholder does not respect the signed acknowledgement of responsibilities and obligations, the authorizing
        manager or the departmental travel card coordinator can cancel the travel card.<sup><a href="#ftn122" id="ftnref122" name="ftnref122"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[122]</a></sup></p><p>If the cardholder has transferred to another department or is no longer an employee of the Government of Canada, it is important that the departmental out-routine include a step to ensure that the travel card is returned to the departmental travel card coordinator for cancellation (Activity 3.2.10.7 – Retrieve or Cancel Card).<sup><a href="#ftn123" id="ftnref123" name="ftnref123"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[123]</a></sup></p><h4>5.4.2.4 Roles and Responsibilities</h4><p>Employees are responsible for completing the request to obtain a travel card; the departmental travel card coordinator is responsible for approving the request. The departmental travel card coordinator, financial services, and the manager are responsible for monitoring the use of the individual designated travel card by reviewing the card provider report, the delinquency report, and the travel
