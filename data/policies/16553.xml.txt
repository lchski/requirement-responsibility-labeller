Effective date"><p><strong>1.1</strong> This standard will take effect on June 1, 2009. Departments will have until May 31, 2014 to fully 
implement section 6.1 of this standard.</p><p><strong>1.2</strong> This version of the standard incorporates updates effective April 1, 2012.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p><strong>2.1 </strong>This standard applies to departments as defined in section 2 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a></em>, unless excluded by 
specific acts, regulations or Orders in Council.</p><p><strong>2.2 </strong>In this standard, any reference to all or part of national or international standards or specifications 
shall be construed as a reference to the most recent version of those standards or specifications, as well as any officially 
issued corrigendum. Any change to referenced national or international standards or specifications that affect this standard 
shall be implemented no later than one year after the effective date of the change.</p><p><strong>2.3 </strong>Section 7.1 and the provisions in section 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 relating to the role of the Treasury Board 
Secretariat in monitoring compliance and directing consequences for non-compliance do not apply with respect to the Office 
of the Auditor General, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Office of the Information Commissioner, the Office of 
the Chief Electoral Officer, the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages 
and the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The deputy heads of these organizations are solely responsible 
for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the standard within their organizations, as well as for responding to cases 
of non-compliance in accordance with any Treasury Board instruments providing principles and guidance on the management 
of compliance.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p><strong>3.1 </strong>Geospatial data is defined as data with implicit or explicit reference to a location relative to 
the Earth. This standard establishes the information infrastructure to support the discovery and use of geospatial information 
and to enable information sharing among departments, with other jurisdictions, and with the private sector.</p><p><strong>3.2 </strong>Geospatial data important to social, economic and cultural well-being is produced or used by federal 
departments, the provinces, territories, and others. This includes mapping products to support activities such as search 
and rescue, geospatial intelligence, and fire fighting. Standardization is essential in this context. It allows data from 
one source to be easily used with those from another source to create a richer and more useful product. The Standard on 
Geospatial Data adopts measures that have been endorsed by federal departments, provincial and territorial governments, 
as well as by academic and private sector participants in the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure. </p><p><strong>3.3 </strong>This standard will allow departments to share data and maximize utility of existing mapping and 
related products. Departments will also be able to exploit commercially available tools and software in common use around 
to world to discover, access and use geospatial data. This will result in significant efficiencies in the sharing and use 
of public sector mapping products. More broadly, it will support departments' mandated programs and services, allowing them 
to address and respond to economic, environmental and societal challenges more effectively.</p><p><strong>3.4 </strong>This standard is issued under the authority of section 7 of the Financial Administration Act by 
the Secretary of the Treasury Board pursuant to Section 3.4 of the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742">Policy on Information Management</a></em> and 
section 3.5 of the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755">Policy on the Management of

the characteristic properties of the data to be recorded, as well as the values each property should have.</p><p>The following conditions apply to the implementation of ISO 19115.</p><ol><li>This specification applies to the creation of metadata for digital geographic datasets, dataset series, 
geographic features and feature properties, and for clearinghouse activities. Affected departments are those that produce, 
use or consume digital geospatial data.</li><li>Its application is not mandatory for geospatial data that has been retired from use or archived, 
or for externally acquired data which does not undergo further departmental modification. When acquiring geospatial data, 
departments shall specify a preference for datasets which include metadata compliant to this standard.</li><li>Compliance requires that core and extended metadata related to existing in-use and new geospatial data 
and applications be in conformance to ISO 19115. </li><li>Conformance requires that all mandatory elements are implemented according to the standard and all optional 
elements, to the extent that they are implemented, also conform to the standard.</li><li>Specific technical compliance requirements are specified in ISO 19115 Clause 6 (Requirements) and Annexes 
A (Metadata schemas) and B (Data dictionary for geographic metadata). User-defined metadata shall be defined and provided 
as specified in Annex C (Metadata extensions and profiles). Any metadata claiming compliance shall pass the requirements 
described in the abstract test suite presented in Annex D (Abstract test suite) of ISO 19115.</li></ol></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C: Implementation Conditions for ISO 19128"><p>ISO 19128 defines protocols to provide interoperable, uniform access by Hyper Text Mark-up Language (HTML) clients to 
maps rendered by map servers on the Internet. Software complying with ISO 19128 enables the automatic overlay in ordinary 
Web browsers of map images obtained from multiple map servers, regardless of map scale, projection, earth coordinate system, 
storage format, or vendor solution.</p><p>The following conditions apply to the implementation of ISO 19128.</p><ol><li>ISO 19128 applies to in-use and new geospatial data that is to be exposed as pictorial view via the World 
Wide Web using Web Map Service technologies (WMS).</li><li>Compliance requires that any department deploying a WMS to present geospatial data as a pictorial view on the Web 
must use a WMS that conforms to all of the elements of ISO 19128. Some departments may produce geospatial data 
with no intent to make it accessible through WMS, in which case conformance to ISO 19128 is not necessary.</li><li>Specific technical compliance requirements describe two classes, a basic WMS and a query-able WMS. Each 
has two subclasses, one for clients and the other for servers. Compliance requires that both a basic and a query-able WMS 
shall satisfy the requirements in Annex A (Conformance tests) in the ISO 19128 standard, and guidelines described within 
the Open Geospatial Consortium Compliance and Interoperability testing program.</li></ol></appendix><appendix anchor="D" title="Appendix D: Implementation Conditions for NAP - Metadata"><p>The North American Profile of ISO 19115 - Geographic information - Metadata (NAP - Metadata), published by the Canadian General Standards Board, identifies the geospatial metadata that are needed for North America to describe geospatial data, including dataset and dataset series, and related Web services. It supports the interoperability of geospatial information, providing a common framework for the description and representation of geospatial metadata. In addition, this Profile provides a mechanism to support cultural and linguistic adaptability by enabling representation of free text in multiple languages and by introducing the NAP Metadata Register describing metadata in multiple languages. It outlines the characteristic properties of the data to be recorded, as well as the values each property should have, to ensure that metadata elements are encoded in a clear and consistent manner. The best practices included in the Profile will help to enhance NAP metadata, to support data management, discovery, distribution, application and archive within and beyond their organization.</p><p>The following conditions apply to the implementation of NAP:</p><ol><li>The NAP - Metadata applies to the creation of metadata for digital North American- based datasets, dataset series, and metadata registers. Affected departments are those that produce, distribute, use or consume digital geospatial data.</li><li>Compliance requires that core and extended metadata related to existing in-use and new geospatial data and applications shall conform to the NAP - Metadata specifications.</li><li>Conformance requires that all mandatory elements are implemented according to the NAP - Metadata and all optional elements, to the extent that they are implemented, also conform.</li><li>Specific technical compliance requirements are specified in NAP - Metadata Clause 6 (Metadata Content) and Clause 7 (Cultural and Linguistic Adaptability), and Annexes A (Data Types) and B (Metadata Schemas).</li><li>Any metadata documents implementing the NAP - Metadata shall be considered in conformance by following the rules stated in Clauses 6 and 7, Annexes A and B, and by meeting the tests presented in Annex C (Conformance Clauses).
