General"><p>1.1 In accordance with the relevant collective agreement, compensation advisors are to deduct union dues from an employee's pay each
month provided that sufficient earnings exist after mandatory and statutory deductions have been taken.  Compensation advisors are to remit the union dues
to the bargaining agent representing the occupational group under which the work is being performed. The occupational group is established by the staffing
action or the resourcing option effected.</p><p>1.2 Compensation advisors deduct union dues from an employee's pay unless that employee is:</p><ul><li>the occupant of a position excluded from a bargaining unit under the <em>Public Service Labour Relations Act (PSLRA)</em>; </li><li>exempt from paying dues because of religious affiliation in accordance with the specific check-off provisions of the collective agreement; </li><li>the occupant of an unrepresented position; or</li><li>not an employee as defined in the <em>PSLRA (see definitions).</em></li></ul></section><section anchor="B.2" title="2. Commencing union dues"><p>2.1 Initial appointments to the core public administration</p><p>2.1.1 The date used to establish when to commence union dues for an initial
appointment is the effective date of the appointment.  Compensation advisors
will commence to deduct union dues following the completion of a full calendar
month of employment.  Therefore, an appointment on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of
the month will result in the completion of that full calendar month of
employment. Union dues deductions will commence on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of
that month.  However, an appointment on any other day of the month will result
in deductions starting on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the following month.</p><p>2.2. Subsequent appointments or other resourcing options within the core public administration</p><p>2.2.1 The date used to establish when to commence union dues for subsequent
appointments or other resourcing options such as deployments, transfers, acting
appointments, demotions, assignments or secondments is the effective date when
the employee actually starts that employment.  Compensation advisors will
commence to deduct union dues in respect of the completion of a full calendar
month of employment. Thus, a subsequent appointment or a change occuring on the
1<sup>st</sup> day of the month will result in the completion of that full
calendar month of employment and union dues deductions will commence on the 1<sup>st</sup>
day of that month.  However, a change of employment on any other day of the
month will result in deductions commencing on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the
following month.</p></section><section anchor="B.3" title="3. Ceasing or amending union dues"><p>3.1 The date used to establish when to cease or amend union dues
is the effective date of the subsequent appointment, the other resourcing
option or when the employee returns to his or her substantive position. Compensation
advisors will cease union dues deductions on the 1st day of the month if the
effective date is the 1st day of that month or the 1st day of the following
month if the effective date is any other day during that month.</p><p>3.2 Religious affiliation</p><p>3.2.2 Once a request for exemption by an employee has been approved
in accordance with the relevant collective agreement, compensation advisors
will cease union dues deductions on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the month if the
effective date is the 1<sup>st</sup> day of that month or the 1<sup>st</sup>
day of the following month if the effective date is any other day during that
month.</p></section><section anchor="B.4" title="4. Leave without pay (temporarily struck-off strength) or return to work"><p>4.1 Union dues are not deducted for an employee who is on leave
without pay for a period of more than a month or on seasonal off-duty status.
Compensation advisors will initiate the temporarily struck-off strength pay
action so that dues automatically cease. Compensation advisors will ensure that
union dues for the month of departure are deducted provided sufficient earnings
exist after statutory and mandatory deductions have been taken.</p><p>4.2 Upon return to work, compensation advisors will ensure that
union dues are deducted during the month the employee returns to work provided
sufficient earnings exist after statutory and mandatory deductions have been
taken.</p><p>4.3 Return to work from a period of disability (rehabilitation program)</p><p>4.3.1 An employee returning to work on reduced hours under an approved rehabilitation program is still considered a full-time employee (or
part-time if the employee was a part-time employee prior to his or her period
of disability).  Compensation advisors will ensure that union dues are deducted
for the month in which the employee returns to work provided sufficient
earnings exist after statutory and mandatory deductions have been taken. </p></section><section anchor="B.5" title="5. New proposal for exclusion of a position"><p>5.1 No objection from bargaining agent</p><p>5.1.1 The position becomes excluded on the date specified in the
order issued by the Public Service Labour Relations Board (PSLRB).  Compensation
advisors will cease union dues deductions on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the
month if the date specified in the order is the 1<sup>st</sup> of that month or
the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the following month if the date specified in the
order is any other day during that month.</p><p>5.2 Objection from bargaining agent</p><p>5.2.1 When informed by the TBS that
a bargaining agent has filed an objection to the exclusion of a position, the human
resources advisor is to take immediate action to ensure that the compensation
advisor holds union dues in suspense until the case is resolved, as stipulated
in the PSLRA.  Compensation advisors will hold union dues in suspense starting on
the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the month if the date of the objection is the 1<sup>st</sup>
of that month or the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the following month if the date of
the objection is any other day during that month.</p><p>5.2.2 If the PSLRB determines that the position is not excluded or
if the employer withdraws the proposal, the human resources advisor is to
inform the compensation unit of such. Compensation advisors are to ensure that
all monies held in suspense in respect to this proposal are redirected to the
bargaining agent.</p><p>5.2.3 If the PSLRB determines that the position is excluded or if
the bargaining agent withdraws the objection, the human resources advisor will
inform the compensation unit of such. Compensation advisors will reimburse all
monies held in suspense in respect to this proposal to the occupant(s) of the
position and will cease union dues deduction on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the
month if the date of the order is the 1<sup>st</sup> of that month or the 1<sup>st</sup>
day of the following month if the date of the order is any other day during
that month.</p><p>5.3. Return of a position to the bargaining unit</p><p>5.3.1 The date used to establish when to start union dues deductions
when a position is returned to the bargaining unit is the date of the order. Compensation
advisors will start union dues deduction on the 1st day of the month if the
effective date of the order is the 1st day of that month or the 1st day of the
following month if the effective date is any other day during that month.</p></section><section anchor="B.6" title="6. Union dues arrears, deficiencies and refunds"><p>6.1 When it is established that arrears or deficiencies in union
dues are outstanding, compensation advisors must communicate immediately with
the bargaining agent to reconcile amounts owed. Compensation advisors will
inform employees accordingly. The compensation advisor is to ensure that the
amount owed is directed to the appropriate bargaining agent.  Bargaining agents
are to be paid all arrears or deficiencies owed within 30 calendar days of discovering
the error, unless both parties agree otherwise. </p><p>6.2 If union dues were directed in error to a bargaining agent,
the compensation advisor is to ensure that the amount owed is directed to the
appropriate bargaining agent within 30 calendar days of discovering the error,
unless both parties agree otherwise.  </p><p>6.3 The compensation advisor will contact the bargaining agent
who received union dues in error to discuss the situation prior to initiating
recovery of the amount(s) in question. The compensation advisor is to request
that the bargaining agent, to which union dues were sent in error, reimburse
the full amount of the union dues within 30 calendar days following the request
for reimbursement, unless both parties agree otherwise.</p><p>6.4 Employees will be responsible for any under-deduction or will
be refunded on any over-deduction as a result of errors.  Compensation advisors
will inform employees accordingly. Compensation advisors are to refund
employees any over-deduction of union dues or recover any under-deduction of
dues within 30 calendar days of discovering the error, unless both parties
agree otherwise.  </p><p>6.5 Compensation advisors are to recover the amount owed from the
employee's pay at the rate of one current month of union dues plus an additional
amount equal to one month of dues.</p></section></appendix></appendices></doc>
