standards designed to provide for acceptable conditions of occupational and
environmental safety and health. Therefore, in keeping with its responsibilities
under the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, the Treasury Board has developed
or adapted a range of standards governing the occupational safety and health of
persons employed in the Public Service.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Definition"><p>A standard is a document outlining specific or minimum working
conditions to be fulfilled, and its development is the result of a particular
consensus or standardization effort.</p><p>If the standard has been consulted upon within the National
Joint Council and forms part of collective agreements, it holds the title of
"directive".</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Objectives"><p>Standards are designed to provide measures which are considered
necessary or appropriate for the prevention of accidents and injuries, and also
for protection against exposure to unhealthy environmental or occupational
factors. Standards are developed with the intention of protecting personnel from
the hazards of their employment, and are conceived so as to exercise the minimum
restriction or interference with operations or levels of service.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Application"><p>Public Service occupational safety and health standards apply to
all departments and agencies, as defined in Part I of Schedule I of
the <em>Public Service Staff Relations Act</em>. The requirements of these
standards, as well as specific directives or procedures issued pursuant to such
standards, are mandatory. Where another code or standard is referred to in a
Public Service standard, it is the responsibility of each department and agency
to apply the most recent edition of such code or standard.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Consultation"><p>All directives have been consulted upon within the National
Joint Council (NJC) and are subject to ongoing consultation and concurrence
whenever changes are proposed. Directives which have been signed-off within NJC
now form part of each Public Service collective agreement and are subject to a
six-year cyclical review process.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Monitoring"><p>The Treasury Board, supported by the inspection, technical and
advisory services of Labour Canada, and by the survey, investigation and
consultative services of Health and Welfare Canada, will monitor the application
of occupational safety and health standards in the Public Service.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="Reference"><p>This chapter replaces chapter 3 of PMM volume 12.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="Enquiries"><p>Enquiries about directives and standards should be referred to
the responsible officers in departmental headquarters who, in turn, may direct
questions regarding their interpretation to the following:</p><ul><li>Safety, Health and Employee Services Group</li><li>Staff Relations Division</li><li>Human Resources Policy Branch</li><li>Treasury Board Secretariat</li></ul></chapter></chapters></doc>
