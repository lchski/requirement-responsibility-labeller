These are arranged in three subprocess groups, as follows.</p><p><strong>Create or Update Asset Record</strong> is the start of the Manage Other Capital Assets business process, which is launched when an expenditure, excluding real property, is identified as a capital asset. The decision to capitalize is made during Manage Procure to Payment (Business Process 3.1) or during Manage Inventory (Business Process 4.3) when the asset is constructed with items previously held as
        inventory. An asset can also be acquired through other means<strong>—</strong>for example, a transfer from another government department, a donation, or the exercising of a bargain purchase option. Capitalized assets must be properly valued and recorded,<sup><a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[2]</a></sup> which can be facilitated by the creation or the update of asset records. An asset can be capitalized as
        a whole asset, a component of a larger asset, an asset under construction, or a betterment to an existing asset. Materiel services or, in certain cases, the responsibility centre manager, is responsible for this subprocess group.</p><p><strong>Maintain Asset Record</strong> involves subprocesses that may be performed cyclically to ensure that:</p><ul><li>Assets are amortized appropriately;</li><li>Repairs, maintenance and betterments are identified, properly differentiated, undertaken and recorded;</li><li>Assets under construction are accurately converted into amortizable assets upon completion; and</li><li>Asset records are adjusted, as required and in a timely manner, to correct discrepancies identified during a periodic physical asset count or a periodic assessment of the asset base.</li></ul><p>Corporate finance, including the chief financial officer and the corporate finance function, is accountable for the resulting financial reporting and is supported by the responsibility centre manager and materiel services in executing these subprocesses.</p><p><strong>Record Asset Disposal</strong> ends the Manage Other Capital Assets business process and involves the recording of the disposal and the physical removal of assets from the department, when authorized by the responsibility centre manager with the delegated authority. The results of a periodic analysis of assets under construction, a periodic physical asset count, a periodic asset
        assessment or other circumstance—for example, an asset is found to be damaged, an asset is identified as missing, or the disposal of an asset is required for security reasons—can lead to a notification for disposal of an asset. Materiel services is responsible for the physical disposal of the asset, and financial services is responsible for recording the disposal for financial reporting
        purposes.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="1" title="1. Date of Issue"><p>This guideline was issued on January 15, 2013.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Context"><p>This guideline is part of a set of guidelines designed to assist departments<sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[3]</a></sup> in implementing common financial management business processes. This guideline supports the <em>Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</em> and the <em>Directive on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</em>.</p><p>This guideline presents the “should be” model for Manage Other Capital Assets, describing roles, responsibilities and recommended activities from a financial management perspective. Most activities are financial in nature, but some non-financial activities are included in order to provide a comprehensive process description; these activities are identified as outside the scope
        of Manage Other Capital Assets. The recommended activities comply with the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, other legislation, and Government of Canada policy instruments.</p><p>Recognizing that deputy heads are ultimately responsible for all aspects of financial management systems within their department, standardizing and streamlining financial management system configurations, business processes and data across government provides significant direct and indirect benefits relative to the quality of financial management in the Government of Canada. By
        establishing a common set of rules, standardization reduces the multitude of different systems, business processes and data that undermine the quality and cost of decision-making information. As government-wide standardization increases, efficiency, integrity and interoperability are improved.<sup><a href="#ftn4" id="ftnref4"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[4]</a></sup></p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Introduction"><section anchor="3_1" title="3.1 Scope"><p>This guideline defines Manage Other Capital Assets, which begins with the development or acquisition of a capital asset (excluding real property) and ends with its disposal. Capital assets are tangible assets that are purchased, constructed, developed or otherwise acquired.<sup><a href="#ftn5" id="ftnref5"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[5]</a></sup> Capital assets include purchased computer
            software, in-house developed software, computer hardware, equipment, fleet vehicles, operational heritage assets, leasehold improvements, assets acquired by capital leases,<sup><a href="#ftn6" id="ftnref6"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[6]</a></sup> and betterments that prolong the period of usefulness or improve the functionality of an asset.<sup><a href="#ftn7" id="ftnref7"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[7]</a></sup></p><p>This business process interacts with Manage Planning and Budgeting (Business Process 1.1) by providing input to the development of the department's investment plan and capital budget, which will drive expenditures for the life-cycle management of assets.</p><p>This guideline covers the following subprocess groups:</p><ul><li>Create or Update Asset Record;</li><li>Maintain Asset Record; and</li><li>Record Asset Disposal.</li></ul><p>Separate business processes will be developed for the financial management of real property and infrastructure assets (Business Process 4.2) and inventory (Business Process 4.3).</p><p>Some financial management activities described in this guideline are also related to internal controls. The intent is neither to provide a complete listing of controls nor to produce a control framework, but the process description may provide useful content for the development of a department's control framework.</p></section><section anchor="3_2" title="3.2 Structure of the Guideline"><p>The remainder of this guideline is structured as follows.

                    asset is constructed with items previously held as inventory. An asset record may also need to be created or updated when the asset is acquired through other means—for example, a transfer from another government department, a donation, or the exercising of a bargain purchase option. An analysis of assets under construction, a periodic asset count, a periodic asset assessment, or the
                    authorization of a disposal may also result in a requirement to create or update the asset record and, possibly, the general ledger. Materiel services or, in certain cases, the responsibility centre manager, is responsible for this subprocess group.</li></ul><h4>Maintain Asset Record</h4><p>One or more of the following subprocesses will repeat cyclically during the life cycle of an asset, based on the asset's state of completeness and status. The corporate finance role, including the chief financial officer and the corporate finance function, is accountable for the resulting financial reporting, and is supported by the responsibility centre manager and materiel services in
            executing the activities of this subprocess group.</p><ul><li><strong>Calculate Monthly Amortization (Subprocess 4.1.2):</strong> Amortization is calculated and recorded by financial services according to department-specific procedures. Amortization is based on asset class and estimated useful life or capacity and is recorded monthly, starting on the first day of the month following the month when the
                    asset came into service.<sup><a href="#ftn13" id="ftnref13"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[13]</a></sup></li><li><strong>Undertake Ongoing Asset Repairs and Maintenance (Subprocess 4.1.3):</strong> Repairs and maintenance are undertaken to ensure that an asset fully, effectively and efficiently meets the requirements of the organizational program it supports. When economically feasible, an asset is repaired, refinished and reused rather than
                    replaced.<sup><a href="#ftn14" id="ftnref14"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[14]</a></sup>  Departments should have procedures to differentiate between betterments, which are capitalized and processed as part of this business process, and repairs and maintenance, which are expensed and require no additional consideration.<sup><a href="#ftn15" id="ftnref15"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[15]</a></sup> The activities of this subprocess are
                    strictly a materiel management function and are therefore outside the scope of the Manage Other Capital Assets business process.</li><li><strong>Conduct Periodic Analysis of Assets Under Construction (Subprocess 4.1.4):</strong> An analysis of assets under construction is conducted periodically to ensure that asset records are updated appropriately during construction and that related expenses are capitalized as required.</li><li><strong>Conduct Periodic Physical Asset Count (Subprocess 4.1.5):</strong> A physical asset count is conducted periodically to confirm the existence of assets and to ensure the accuracy of the asset records in the departmental financial and materiel management system.</li><li><strong>Conduct Periodic Asset Assessment (Subprocess 4.1.6):</strong> An asset assessment is a strategic or an operational review of part or all of the organization's asset base. It measures the extent to which the asset base continues to meet the organization's needs and validates the reasonableness of the value recorded in the
                    departmental financial and materiel management system. The assessment may be conducted periodically or for a specific event—for example, the review of a departmental program.</li></ul><h4>Record Asset Disposal</h4><ul><li><strong>Process Asset Disposal (Subprocess 4.1.7):</strong> Assets are formally delisted from the department's asset records when authorized by the responsibility centre manager with the delegated authority. Materiel services is responsible for the physical disposal of an asset, and corporate finance is responsible for recording the
                    disposal for financial reporting purposes once the physical disposal of the asset is complete.</li></ul></section><section anchor="5_2" title="5.2 Create or Update Asset Record Subprocess Group"><p>This subprocess group involves creating and keeping capital asset records up to date.

An asset record may also need
            to be created or updated when the asset is acquired through other means—for example, a transfer from another government department, a donation, or the exercising of a bargain purchase option. An analysis of assets under construction, a periodic physical asset count, a periodic asset assessment, or the authorization of a disposal may also result in a requirement to
            create or update the asset record and, possibly, the general ledger. The information accumulated in the asset record supports the monitoring of asset performance and helps ensure that repairs, refurbishing and replacements are carried out before the asset becomes unserviceable, uneconomical or both.<sup><a href="#ftn17" id="ftnref17"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[17]</a></sup></p><p><a href="#ldr4">Figure 4</a> depicts the Level 3 subprocess flow for Create or Update Asset Record.</p><div id="ldr4" class="alignCenter"><p><em><strong>Figure 4.

Under the directive,
            whenever practicable, departments must make surplus materiel assets available, whether gratuitously, at book value or at market value, to other federal departments, before disposing of them outside the federal domain.<sup><a href="#ftn31" id="ftnref31"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span>[31]</a></sup> The directive also outlines disposal methods for certain types of assets—for example, right of first refusal of all
            surplus personal computers must be given to the Industry Canada Computers for Schools Program. These various methods, which may require approval, lead to the physical removal of the asset from the department's premises (<strong>Activity 4.1.7.3 – Physically Dispose of Asset</strong>).</p><p>Once the asset has been physically disposed of, the information resulting from the disposal—for example, the disposal date and, in the case of a sale, the proceeds from the sale—is used to record the disposal in the departmental financial and materiel management system. This involves the following activities:</p><ul><li>Recording the asset disposal in the asset record in the sub-ledger (<strong>Activity 4.1.7.4 – Record Disposal in Asset Record</strong>); and</li><li>Recording the journal entry to update the general ledger (<strong>Activity4.1.7.5 – Record Journal Entry</strong>), which could include recording a gain or a loss on the sale of the asset.</li></ul><p>The process flow then continues to Manage Financial Close (Business Process 8.2).</p><p>When the asset sub-ledger and the general ledger are integrated in the departmental financial and materiel management system, these two steps are typically combined; recording the disposal in the sub-ledger automatically generates the corresponding journal entry.</p><p>The collection of proceeds from the sale of an asset to an external party outside the federal domain is managed through Manage Revenue, Receivables and Receipts (Business Process 2.1).</p><p>When assets are transferred to other government departments and the transfer involves an exchange of funds, the department's designated program analyst at the Treasury Board Secretariat should be contacted. The Secretariat will help the department to select the appropriate Expenditure Management System mechanism to access these funds. Materiel services should ensure that the historical
            information in that department's asset record is transferred with the physical asset, to ensure continuity of management by the new custodian.</p><p>The disposal of the asset ends the Manage Other Capital Assets business process.</p><h5>5.4.1.2 Roles and Responsibilities</h5><p>The responsibility centre manager is responsible and accountable for obtaining authorization for the disposal of an asset from the responsibility centre manager with the delegated authority.
