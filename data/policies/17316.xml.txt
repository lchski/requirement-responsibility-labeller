In the definitions for the "National Building Code of Canada" and the "National Fire Code of Canada" references to the 2005 versions of these codes have been removed.</p><p>These amendments are effective on April 11, 2019.</p></notetoreader><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="Effective date"><p>1.1 This standard takes effect on April 1, 2010.</p><p>1.2 This standard replaces the Treasury Board <em>Policy on Fire Protection, Investigation and Reporting</em> (1994-06-03).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Application"><p>2.1 This standard applies to all departments within the meaning of section 2 of the <em>Financial Administration
Act</em> (FAA), unless specific acts or regulations override it. </p><p>2.2 Sections 6.1.6 and 6.1.7 do not apply to the Department of
National Defence, for which fire protection services are provided by the
Canadian Forces Fire Marshall pursuant to the Queen's Regulations and Orders
issued under the authority of the <em>National Defence Act</em>. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Context"><p>3.1 Further to the Treasury Board <em>Policy on Management of Real
Property</em>, this standard establishes requirements for the departmental
Fire Protection Coordinator with respect to the protection of federal real
property and the safety of those who occupy and use these properties.</p><p>3.2 Fire protection is an essential and integral part of program and service
delivery and key to public safety, real property protection and business
continuity. Fire protection helps avert the interruption of government services
that depend on physical infrastructure.</p><p>3.3 Fire protection is a continuous risk management process in which risks
to real property and to the public are identified and reduced, and the costs
and consequences of harmful or damaging incidents arising from those risks are
minimized and contained. Fire protection relies on the collaborative efforts of
federal custodians and tenants, private sector building owners and local fire services. Fire protection
requires a comprehensive approach involving the application of building, fire,
and occupational health and safety codes. These codes are primarily concerned
with life safety and property protection. The National Building Code of Canada
(NBC), the National Fire Code of Canada (NFC) and the National Farm Building
Code of Canada (NFBC) prescribe the minimum standards for fire protection on
federal property. </p><p>3.4 In most areas, local fire services provide firefighting and suppression
services for federal real property; therefore, coordination and cooperation
between departments and local fire officials
is important. Furthermore, the application of local building and fire codes may
be sufficient when their requirements are equivalent to or greater than the
requirements of the national codes.</p><p>3.5 This standard is issued pursuant to section 7 of the FAA.</p><p>3.6 This standard is to be read in conjunction with the <em>Policy on Management of Real Property. </em></p><p>3.7 Treasury Board has delegated to the President of the Treasury Board the authority to amend this standard.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Definitions"><dl><dt><strong>Applicable local codes</strong></dt><dd>Are building and fire codes enacted in Canada by provinces, territories and municipalities and abroad by local jurisdictions that meet or exceed the requirements of the National Building Code of Canada, the National Fire Code of Canada and the National Farm Building Code of Canada and are applied without contravening any federal statutes, laws or regulations and without prejudice to the Crown's legal and constitutional rights.</dd><dt><strong>Departmental Fire Protection Coordinator</strong></dt><dd>A senior official designated by the Deputy Head for the purpose of overseeing the implementation of the Fire Protection Standard.</dd><dt><strong>Fire</strong></dt><dd>Means any instance of destructive and uncontrolled burning of or in a federally owned or leased structure.</dd><dt><strong>Fire protection</strong></dt><dd>Means the protection of the life and safety of persons and real property from fire, including its prevention, detection, containment and extinguishment as well as alerting persons of its presence.</dd><dt><strong>Serious fire</strong></dt><dd><p>Is a fire that meets any of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Involves death or serious injury;</li><li>Results in a direct $250,000 loss or greater;</li><li>Causes a significant interruption of essential federal services;</li><li>Requires the suppression services of one or more local fire departments;</li><li>Necessitates immediate action to prevent reoccurrence; or</li><li>Damages the heritage character of one or more classified heritage buildings.</li></ul></dd><dt><strong>National Building Code of Canada</strong></dt><dd>The NBC (as amended periodically) sets out the requirements for the design and construction of new buildings.
