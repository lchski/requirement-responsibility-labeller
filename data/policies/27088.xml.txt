Context"><p><strong>3.1</strong> Canadians are increasingly using <a href="#def4">mobile devices</a>, such as smartphones and tablets, to access Government of Canada information and services. To keep pace with this demand and to better serve Canadians, the Government of Canada is focused on optimizing its online information and services for mobile devices.</p><p><strong>3.2</strong> Canadians access Government of Canada information and services from their mobile devices through websites, Web applications and device-based mobile applications.</p><p><strong>3.3</strong> Websites and Web applications are the Government of Canada’s primary means of delivering information and services online. This standard is designed to ensure that websites and Web applications are optimized for mobile devices to ensure that information and services reach the widest possible audience. Device-based mobile applications are provided only where user or business
            needs for device-specific features cannot be supported through websites or Web applications that are optimized for mobile devices.</p><p><strong>3.4</strong> This standard introduces an efficient model for building and maintaining device-based mobile applications by reducing duplication through re-use of components, standardization of processes and collaboration on common solutions. This model consists of the following:</p><ul><li>Departments continue to commission, fund and define requirements as well as develop and maintain content for device-based mobile applications.</li><li>Departments identified as Government of Canada Centres of Expertise on Mobile or external service providers design, develop, test and maintain device-based mobile applications, with the exception of device-based mobile applications that use secure logins.</li><li>The department that is mandated as the Government of Canada publishing entity independently tests, publishes and retires device-based mobile applications.</li></ul><p><strong>3.5</strong> The layout and design prescribed in the <em><a href="/ws-nw/mo-om/ts-st/index-eng.asp">Technical specifications for the Web and Mobile Presence</a></em> help users recognize Government of Canada information and services.</p><p><strong>3.6</strong> This standard supports the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755">Policy on Management of Information Technology</a></em>.</p><p><strong>3.7</strong> This standard is issued under the authority of section 7 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a></em> by the Secretary of the Treasury Board pursuant to subsection 6(4) of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and section 3.5 of the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755">Policy on
