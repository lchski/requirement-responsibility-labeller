Introduction"><p>The approaches outlined in the <em>Guideline on Service Agreements: Essential Elements</em> reflect current best practices from the private sector, other jurisdictions, and consultations with government departments. This <em>Guideline</em> supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25594"><em>Directive on Internal Support Services</em></a> and will also support organizations in pursuing consolidation and greater efficiencies in
        the delivery of services. The <em>Guideline</em> recognizes that although the use and applicability of service agreements should be standard government-wide, service agreements themselves should be tailored to the circumstances and requirements of the participating departments, the various collaborative arrangements they may use, and the complexity of the service relationship. The goal of
        this <em>Guideline</em> is to help service managers and executives produce effective agreements that support client-centered, well-managed services.</p><p>This <em>Guideline</em> outlines a flexible approach to developing service agreements tailored to the specific requirements of a particular relationship and/or the complexity or scope of the service relationship. Application of the approaches described in this <em>Guideline</em> should improve the consistency and clarity of service relationships across government.</p><h3>Background</h3><div class="floatRight width50 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Did You Know?</h4><p>A <strong>service</strong> is the provision of a specific output, including information, that addresses one or more needs of an intended recipient and contributes to the achievement of an outcome.</p><p>For example, Public Works and Government Services Canada's Shared Travel Service Initiative (STSI) books air reservations (specific output) through its call centre and its on-line self-service booking services (set of actions) for all government employees (the recipient) in support of its program delivery responsibilities (outcome).</p></div><p>A <strong>service agreement</strong> is a formal agreement between two or more parties (e.g., between departments, between a department and a common or shared service provider, or between various levels of government) that articulates the terms and conditions of a particular <strong>service relationship</strong>. The term “department” applies generically to organizations
        listed in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>, Schedules 1, 1.1, and 2.</p><p><strong>Service agreements</strong> serve three primary functions:</p><ul><li>Articulating the expectations of the parties to the agreement.</li><li>Providing a mechanism for governance and issue resolution.</li><li>Acting as a scorecard against which to examine performance and results.</li></ul><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Note</h4><p>Although the principles and elements involved in a service agreement between two government departments are equally applicable to service arrangements with external non-government organizations (<abbr title="Non-Government Organization">NGO</abbr>s) or private sector entities, these types of arrangements are typically governed by a legal contract, a grant or contribution agreement, or through an invoice or sales agreement. These types of contracts and agreements are not within the scope of this guideline.</p></div><p>Service agreements can enhance governance, accountability, and service quality by clearly defining roles, responsibilities, processes, and performance expectations. The practice of establishing service agreements is strongly recommended in any type of client / service provider or collaborative service relationship.</p><p>This <em>Guideline</em> applies to client/provider arrangements in which a Government of Canada service is provided by one department to, or on behalf of, another department; when two or more departments collaborate on a service initiative or project; or when a province or municipality delivers a service for or jointly with a federal government department, or a department provides a service to
        a province or municipality. It reflects the current operating and policy environment and will be updated to reflect any legal and/or policy changes that affect the development and execution of service agreements.</p><p>The creation of service agreements is a sound management practice in any type of client / service provider or collaborative service arrangement including:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Bi-lateral: </em></strong>service arrangements where one department provides selected services (on a service-by-service basis) to one or more other departments.</li><li><strong><em>Co-op sharing: </em></strong>arrangements where a small number of participating departments pool resources (i.e., people or money) to fund a shared resource or a one-time project. </li><li><strong><em>Cluster group: </em></strong>arrangements where a number of participating departments jointly fund and govern an ongoing service, a joint procurement, or a project.</li><li><strong><em>Shared service: </em></strong>arrangements where a service, typically an internal service, is provided by an organization or unit created with a specific mandate to deliver that service to internal clients. Such arrangements are characterized by an independence that enables equitable treatment of all clients, a client-controlled
                governance structure and client retained budgets through which they purchase services from the shared service provider.</li><li><strong><em>Common services,: </em></strong>mandatory or optional, are offered by a central supplier – a common service organization (<abbr title="Common Service Organization">CSO</abbr>) – to support the requirements of departments. Departments must use the mandatory common services listed in Appendix E of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12025"><em>Common Services Policy</em></a>. Departments may use optional
                common services offered by <abbr title="Business Continuity Plan">CSO</abbr>s when it makes sense to do so.</li><li><strong><em>Arrangements with other jurisdictions: </em></strong>where a province or municipality delivers a service for or jointly with the federal government or alternatively where a department provides a service to a province or municipality in return for a fee.</li></ul><p>The term “client” applies generically to both clients in a client / service provider arrangement and to participants in a collaborative service arrangement. The term “service provider” or “provider” applies generically to providers in a client / service provider arrangement and the lead department that is delivering a service within a collaborative
        arrangement.</p><p>This <em>Guideline</em> should be read in conjunction with the following documents:</p><ul><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25748"><em>Guideline on Service Agreements: An Overview</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25750"><em>Guideline on Service Standards</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12251"><em>Guide to Costing</em></a></li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25594"><em>Directive on Internal Support Services</em></a></li><li>Other Treasury Board policy instruments relevant to service delivery or related to governance, price, and performance.</li></ul><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h3 class="alignCenter">The Structure of this <em>Guideline</em></h3><p>This <em>Guideline</em> is divided into the following sections.</p><p><a href="#cha2"><strong>Section 2</strong></a> outlines the suggested steps for defining a service agreement.</p><p><a href="#cha3"><strong>Section 3</strong></a> identifies key considerations when building a service relationship.</p><p><a href="#cha4"><strong>Section 4</strong></a> looks at the types of service agreements and the situations to which they are best utilized.</p><p><a href="#cha5"><strong>Section 5</strong></a> takes a closer look at the specific elements that should be considered when developing a service agreement – scope, governance, operations, finances, performance, and implementation.</p><p><a href="#appA"><strong>Appendix A</strong></a> provides a checklist of the key elements typically included in a service agreement.</p><p><a href="#appB"><strong>Appendices B to D</strong></a> present examples of the main types of service agreements.</p></div></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Defining and Building the Service Relationship"><div class="floatRight width50 highlightBox"><h3 class="alignCenter">Important!</h3><p>Before initiating a service relationship whereby a department is providing a service to or on behalf of another department, the parties to the agreement are encouraged to ensure that they have:</p><ul><li>The legal mandate to provide the service.</li><li>The authority to recover cost, if applicable.</li><li>Revenue re-spending authority, if applicable.</li><li>Delegated <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a> authorities for sections 33 and 34 to the service provider as required.</li><li>Any other necessary authorities, including authority to collect personal information.</li></ul></div><p>A <strong>service relationship</strong> between two or more parties arises when one provides a service to another, typically on a fee for service basis (client/provider relationship); or when two or more departments collaborate by pooling resources to jointly create and/or deliver a service or project (collaborative relationship).</p><p>A <strong>service agreement</strong> is a formal agreement between two or more parties that articulates the terms and conditions of a particular <strong>service relationship</strong>. </p><p>Defining the service relationship, specifically the nature and scope of the services involved, how the relationship will be governed and operated, finances, and the performance measurement and reporting regime, is therefore, a necessary prerequisite to defining a service agreement. </p><p>Developing a service relationship typically involves answers to the following questions:</p><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h3 class="alignCenter">Important!</h3><p>Depending on the underlying legislative or policy authority, whether the service provider is a Common Service Organization under the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12025"><em>Common Service Policy</em></a> or not, and/or the funding mechanism in play (appropriation, revolving fund, or net-voting authority), fees or charges for services may be based on full costs, incremental costs, or some other agreed upon basis.  For the purposes of this guideline, the term “cost” is used generically.  Parties to a service agreement must determine the appropriate basis underlying the service's fee structure.</p></div><ul><li><strong>What services am I receiving and for how much?  What am I providing and what is the basis of recovery if any?</strong>  Stable, long-term service relationships are based on win-win propositions. The client receives value for money while the provider successfully delivers the service while covering their costs through
                appropriation or some other basis of recovery.</li><li><strong>How will it work?</strong>  Successful service relationships can sour over seemingly minor operational misunderstandings. Therefore, the parties should clarify governance, relative roles and responsibilities, related decision-making powers and approval processes, and put mechanisms in place to solve and/or mitigate issues in a
                timely fashion. The implications of client compliance with service provider standards should also be fully understood. </li><li><strong>How do we get there?</strong>  Implementation of a new service relationship has an impact on both clients and providers and often demands a level of commitment and resourcing that can stretch the capacity of both parties. Implementation of a new client/provider or collaborative arrangement typically involves changes in roles,
                responsibilities and processes, the implementation of new technologies or interfaces, the training of users and support staff, and the transfer and/or conversion of data. The parties should define the implementation approach, timeframes, responsibilities, and resource and skill requirements.</li></ul><h3>Key Inputs</h3><p>A degree of preparation is required by both parties before they can productively sit down to discuss a service relationship.</p><p>Ideally, the clients should have a clear idea of the problem they are trying to solve or opportunity they are wanting to take advantage of and how they expect the new service relationship will help or contribute to these considerations. They should have a good understanding of their current baseline costs and their current and desired levels of service. If there are non-negotiable
        or unique business requirements (e.g., functions that must be retained, privacy or independence concerns, implementation timelines or deadlines, unique regional or functional requirements), these should be clearly identified. In short, clients need to be good buyers.</p><p>Ideally, the service providers will have defined their services offerings (i.e., service inventory), how the service is offered (e.g., basic and optional service packages), how the service is delivered (e.g., channels, minimum technical requirements, transferred and retained functions, business processes), the cost recovery model if applicable, and the implementation approach and
        activities. The service providers should also determine whether a new client can be accommodated within their existing capacity or whether an incremental investment is required to expand their productive capacity.</p><p>In some cases, particularly when new services are involved, the client and/or service provider may not have the information required to fully define all aspects of their service relationship. Service agreements can still be concluded in cases where more analysis or a pilot project is required. However, for the protection of both parties, a process to complete the analysis or pilot
        should be jointly formulated and articulated in the service agreement. The process should include appropriate off-ramps should the analysis or pilot indicate that a viable win-win relationship is not achievable. It is preferable that a non-viable relationship be abandoned at the outset before significant investments or contractual commitments are made.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h3 class="alignCenter">Checklist: Defining and Building the Service Relationship</h3><h4>Recommended Practice</h4><ul><li>Undertake a joint planning exercise to define the service relationship</li><li>Determine the governance and management regimes for each service and for the relationship as a whole</li></ul><h4>Considerations</h4><ul><li>Number and scope of services included</li><li>Service levels and performance expectations</li><li>Length of the service agreement</li><li>Roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of each party to the arrangement</li><li>Notice period and processes for a party leaving the arrangement or for terminating the arrangement as a whole</li><li>Nature and complexity of the service arrangement</li><li>Risks associated with the proposed service relationship</li><li>Experience of the parties in developing and implementing service arrangements</li><li>Implications to the organization of the implementation of the service arrangement</li></ul></div></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3.

The choice of agreement and the relationship to one another depends upon the scope and complexity of the service relationship and services
        involved.</p><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Important!</h4><p>Regardless of their complexity, it is strongly recommended that service managers consult expert counsel, such as corporate and legal services, in developing their service agreements.</p></div><p>Within a <strong>service relationship</strong>, the parties may share, provide, or consume one or more services.

Service agreements can be put in place quickly and easily when the service relationship is relatively simple and well understood and there are few issues to resolve. However, the preparation of more complex service agreements (e.g., to maximize the use of resources, respond to government-wide planning
        activities, or support horizontal initiatives between two or more departments) normally requires additional time and effort to complete.</p><p>Generally, there are three types of documents that are used to articulate a service agreement:  a <strong>Memorandum of Understanding</strong>, a <strong>Master Agreement,</strong> and a <strong>Service Level Agreement</strong>. </p><p>Typically:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>)</strong> defines the broad parameters of a service relationship between the parties to the agreement, the service vision, and the exercise of decision-making authorities (see example, <a href="#appB">Appendix B</a>).</li><li>A <strong>Master Agreement (<abbr title="Master Agreement">MA</abbr>)</strong> is an overarching document that sets out the services included, how the bundle of services will be managed, and the operational details that are common for all services. The <abbr title="Master Agreement">MA</abbr> lays the overarching framework for multiple service level agreements, typically one for each service covered by the <abbr title="Master Agreement">MA</abbr> (see
                example, <a href="#appC">Appendix C</a>).</li><li>A <strong>Service Level Agreement (<abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>)</strong> establishes the operating parameters and performance expectations between the parties to the agreements. Normally a <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr> is established for each line of service or project (see example, <a href="#appD">Appendix D</a>).</li></ul><p>These documents can be used alone or in combination. The choice of document(s) and their connection to one another depends upon the complexity of the service relationship as demonstrated by the following examples.</p><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h3 class="alignCenter">Service Agreements in Practice: An Example</h3><p>As part of its service agreement with a client department to provide or arrange for overseas accommodation and support, Department X establishes one or more <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>s that address items such as communications, housing, office space, and security.</p></div><h3>Simple or One-tiered Service Agreement</h3><p>A simple service agreement is used when the service delivery situation is uncomplicated (e.g., roles and responsibilities are clear, obligations are readily identified and evaluated, and there are few or no risks). A simple service agreement can be as straightforward as a one or two-page <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr> between two or more parties, if it addresses certain elements of scope, governance, the financial
        arrangements, and performance. Inclusion of service levels in some manner is strongly encouraged in even the most basic of service delivery situations.</p><h3>Medium or Two-tiered Service Agreement</h3><p>Where the service relationship, management, and delivery are moderately complex, service agreements are normally divided into two documents. The first document – often an <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr> – describes the organizational relationships (including governance) and management processes that will regulate delivery of the service. It identifies the commitments the parties are undertaking
        and establishes the vision, mission, and mandate that frame the service relationship.</p><p>The second document, a <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr><strong>,</strong> delineates the operational specifics of the service, including clear, detailed information about the scope and service levels to be delivered. The <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr> sets out detailed performance expectations, including service and performance standards, and acts as the basis for future evaluation activities.</p><h3>Complex or Three-tiered Service Agreement</h3><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Important!</h4><p>Depending on the complexity of the service arrangement, parties may choose to combine the planning phases. Typically, negotiations for more complicated service arrangements (i.e., “three-tiered” service agreements) take place in phases, with documentation produced at the conclusion of each phase.</p></div><p>Complex service relationships and collaborative arrangements are most appropriately captured through a three-tiered service agreement, typically involving a <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, one or more <abbr title="Master Agreement">MA</abbr>s, and one or more <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>s. The <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr> typically defines the broad aspects of the service relationship between the parties particularly what the parties expect to mutually accomplish through the agreement and how the
        parties will govern the relationship. The <abbr title="Master Agreement">MA</abbr> sets out the services and/or projects, how the services or projects will be managed, and overarching operational parameters that are common across all projects and services. In most three-tiered service agreements, <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>s are established for each line of service outlining the scope, financial arrangements, and performance expectations.</p><p class="alignCenter"><strong>Figure 1: Examples of Types of Service Agreements</strong></p><p class="alignCenter"><img src="/pol-cont/25761-01-eng.jpg" width="576" height="403" alt="Figure 1: Examples of Types of Service Agreements" id="ldr1" longdesc="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25761&amp;section=longdeschtml&amp;ld=1" /></p><h3>Choosing the Right Type of Agreement(s)</h3><p>No single approach or format for service agreements is suitable for all circumstances.

Identify any limitations to the services under consideration.</li><li><strong><em>Complexity of the client/provider or collaborative arrangement: </em></strong>Assess issues around the type of arrangement, the number of parties involved, the complexity of any procurement required, integration with other departments, relative roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities, cost, and political
                visibility.</li><li><strong><em>Type of service covered: </em></strong>Consider the complexity of the function, line of business, or services included in the agreement.</li><li><strong><em>Term (start and end date) of the relationship: </em></strong>Assess the risks and impacts related to the duration of the relationship.</li><li><strong><em>Risk: </em></strong>Assess the nature and level of risks.</li><li><strong><em>Experience: </em></strong>Note the experience of each party in developing and implementing comparable services or collaborative arrangements.</li><li><strong><em>Implications of the change: </em></strong>Consider possible consequences for staff, managers, and the department as a whole, including the impact of disruptions on operational and organizational structures.</li></ul><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h3 class="alignCenter">Checklist: Basic Elements of Service Agreements</h3><ul><li>Legal Names of all the Parties to the Agreement</li><li>Recitals (elements that typically summarize the mandate, authorities and capabilities of each party; provide useful background information, and; document the parties' general understanding of the agreement (typically “whereas” and “therefore” statements)</li><li>Definitions</li><li>Commencement Date and Duration</li><li>References to Supporting Documents or Agreement(s)</li><li>Process for Maintaining the Agreement</li><li>Notice Period and Process for Parties Wishing to Leave the Agreement</li><li>Designated Officials</li><li>Signatories</li></ul></div></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Elements of a Service Agreement"><p>Service relationships are generally defined by scope (e.g., services expressed in terms of functions, processes, activities, or projects), governance (e.g., decision powers, roles and responsibilities), operations (e.g., day-to-day operating procedures), financial arrangements (e.g., fee structures, settlement arrangements), performance (e.g., expected outputs, levels of service, reporting),
        and implementation (e.g., activities, timelines, level of effort).</p><p>Across these areas there are key elements, included in a service agreement(s), which together, articulate the service relationship. The elements are described below.</p><section anchor="5.1" title="Scope"><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Important!</h4><p>Service scope includes any and all services, activities, processes, functions, projects, and initiatives provided by or shared with the other parties to a service relationship.  The nature of service scope varies depending on the particulars of the service relationship.</p></div><p>Clarity of <strong>scope</strong> is at the core of any service relationship. Disagreements regarding the scope, quality, and level of service are common. To maintain a positive relationship, it is critical that the parties have a clear understanding of scope so that the extent of work involved and respective obligations are clearly understood.</p><p>Understanding scope starts with the identification of the services covered by the relationship. Service scope may be expressed in terms of functions, processes, activities, or projects. </p><p>Moving to a new service arrangement is ultimately a transition from an existing state (i.e., who, what, where, and how the client is currently delivering the service) to a targeted end state (i.e., who, what, where, and how the service provider will deliver an equivalent or enhanced service).</p><p>Details are important. To fully understand the scope, the parties to the agreement should discuss and agree upon the following:</p><ul><li>What services, functions, processes, and activities are in scope?  What portions will the provider now deliver?  What portions will be retained and delivered by the client?</li><li>Are there gaps between the scope of the provider's service and the clients' existing in-house service? How will any gaps be dealt with?</li><li>Are there gaps between existing service levels and the provider's service levels?  How will any gaps be dealt with?</li><li>How will processes change?  How will process hand-offs now work between the client and the provider?</li><li>Are there network, application, firewall, and interface changes required?</li><li>What are the relative roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of the client and the provider?  What are the impacts on people, including training, job transition, and workplace relocation?</li><li>What is the preferred channel for delivering each service or function?  Self-serve?  In-person?  Call or e-mail centre? Will there be a shift in service channels over time for efficiencies?</li><li>Are there transformation opportunities?  What projects need to be in scope to realize the potential benefits?</li></ul><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h4 class="alignCenter">Service Bundles</h4><p>Service providers may bundle their services to provide options to clients and / or to more closely tie an appropriate fee structure to how the services are consumed.</p><p><strong><em>Basic service package: </em></strong>Typically includes all services that all clients use on a regular basis and at a standard level of service for all clients.</p><p><strong><em>Supplementary services package: </em></strong>Typically includes services that are only required by some of the provider's clients.</p><p><strong><em>Optional service extensions: </em></strong>Typically a function that complements a basic or supplementary service.  For example, expert financial advisory services as an extension to a basic reporting service.</p><p><strong><em>Project services: </em></strong>For projects required to transition or upgrade a client, a provider may offer a team of experts to assist the client on a project-by-project basis.</p><p><strong><em>Service level extensions: </em></strong>Where a client requires a level of service (e.g., hours of operation, turnaround times, the reporting frequency) beyond the standard level offered, a provider may offer a range of optional service level extensions.</p><p><strong><em>Unique services: </em></strong>Special services, functions, or features to address a unique, business-critical need for one client.</p><p>Where offered, and as part of the service level agreement, each client chooses the packages they need.  Alternatively, clients may choose to retain services in-house rather than purchasing options or extensions from the provider.</p></div><p>The objective of the scope discussion is to clearly identify the level of effort involved so that adequate resources can be applied. Clarity of scope will also support operational and implementation planning.</p><p>To the extent that the service description cannot be satisfactorily defined at the time the service agreement is prepared, a process to determine scope with an appropriate sign-off process should be developed and included in the agreement. Opting-out clauses should be considered as a full investigation of scope and related costs may affect the feasibility of the arrangement.</p><p><strong>In particular, clarity of scope is important to reduce the risk of disputes.</strong>  This is particularly important in arrangements where defining scope is a challenge and/or scope is a significant driver of cost and operational complexity.</p><h4>Scope Elements</h4><p>Depending upon the complexity of the service arrangement, a service agreement may include provisions for some or all of the following scope elements:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Vision or purpose statement: </em></strong>Articulate a clearly defined vision statement and associated business strategy to ensure that participants agree on what they expect to achieve from the service relationship and to provide a consistent reference point for managing the relationship.</li><li><strong><em>Declaration of key principles: </em></strong>Outline the principles or values that underpin the development and implementation of the service relationship. The declaration can include statements about the mode of operation, commitments to particular business practices, and operational practices such as transparency
                and openness.</li><li><strong><em>Services and activities: </em></strong>Identify the services, functions, processes, activities, or projects that are subject to the agreement. Where the service provider is already delivering the service and scope is well understood, simply referring to the name of the service may be sufficient. In more complex
                environments, a detailed description of the service or activity may be required. Equally important is the identification of services or functions that are out of scope and likely to be retained and performed by the client. There may also be new functions or activities that the client may need to develop in order to manage the service relationship (contract management) and these should
                be clearly noted.</li><li><strong><em>Service bundles / service inventory: </em></strong>In more complex environments, service providers may bundle their services to provide options to clients or to more closely tie an appropriate fee structure to how the services are consumed (see box on service bundles). To the extent that these exist, indicate the

                including availability and accessibility commitments.  If the client will be required to adopt particular service provider standards (e.g., processes, applications, communications or interface protocols), the implications and timeframes for adoption should be specified. If there is a plan to shift clients to more cost effective channels over time, these should also be clearly
                defined.</li><li><strong><em>Relative roles and responsibilities: </em></strong>Outline the expected roles and responsibilities for both client and provider in the new service arrangement. This is particularly important for services retained by the client.</li><li><strong><em>Key service assumptions: </em></strong>Include any other requirements or assumptions that provide clarity or specificity about scope. Some examples include assumptions or requirements related to regional operations or support for remote locations, unique business requirements, or any specific deviations from a provider's
                standard service or service levels.</li></ul><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h4 class="alignCenter">Checklist: Scope Elements of Service Agreements</h4><ul><li>Vision or Purpose Statement</li><li>Declaration of Key Principles</li><li>Services and Activities</li><li>Service Bundles / Service Inventory</li><li>Tiered Service / Delivery Channels</li><li>Relative Roles and Responsibilities</li><li>Key Service Assumptions </li></ul></div></section><section anchor="5.2" title="Governance"><div class="floatRight width50 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Important!</h4><p>Governance plays a different role at different stages in the lifecycle of a relationship.  Consider:</p><ul><li><em>Strategic Governance:  </em>A critical role required to set the overall directions and delivery model for the service arrangement and relationship.</li><li><em>Transitional and Project Governance:  </em>To drive the transition and any related transformation initiatives toward the end-state vision for the service relationship.</li><li><em>Operational Governance:  </em>Responsible for operational direction and oversight within the overall directions set by strategic governance and includes the accountability framework through which parties meet agreed expectations.</li></ul><p>Strategic governance can be established early on to set the parameters of the service relationship.  It continues throughout the lifecycle of the relationship, supported first by transitional governance followed closely by operational governance.</p></div><p><strong>Governance</strong> relates to the standards and processes that help achieve goals by enabling decisions to be made, and authority and accountability to be shared. Governance also refers to the structures that support these standards and processes, such as an Assistant Deputy Minister (<abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr>) Steering Committee or Senior Management Board.</p><p>Governance plays an integral role in developing, implementing, and managing a successful service relationship. Governance is like steering a ship – setting the course toward the destination and then making frequent steering adjustments to guide the ship through the currents and shoals along the way.</p><p>In developing good governance and accountability arrangements, it is helpful to focus on three key questions:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Who decides what?</strong></em></p><p>Decision making is at the heart of governance. Governance deals with the ways in which decisions are influenced and taken. Governance includes both authority (formal roles) and influence (informal and advisory roles) in decision making. Governance is a continuing process that extends beyond policy decision making and into implementation and operational decision making.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Who does what?</strong></em></p><p>To be effective, a governance arrangement has outcomes that are seen as legitimate by the key stakeholders – in this case, clients and service providers. Legitimacy is derived from many factors including a clear and accepted process leading to decisions made by the appropriate bodies or persons; assurance that the views and interests of all parties are taken into account; and a
                right of recourse if stakeholders are unhappy with the process or outcomes. These requirements are factored into the structuring of the governance arrangement, its form and composition.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Who answers for results?</strong></em></p><p>Accountability
                    is taking responsibility for performance in light of agreed expectations. Authority can be delegated but accountability cannot. For example, if the ship runs aground, the captain is accountable, no matter who was at the helm.</p></li></ul><p>The governance elements in a service agreement are designed to ensure that the parties have a clear understanding, not only of <strong><em>who decides</em></strong> and <strong><em>who does what</em></strong>, but also <strong><em>when</em></strong> and <strong><em>how</em></strong> each will act in terms of enabling the service relationship. This will help ensure transparency and
                accountability, promote flexibility, and enable the parties to adapt and adjust the relationship and agreement in a systematic way as circumstances require.</p><div class="floatRight width50 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Governance Clause: An Example</h4><p>This section deals with overall governance and the respective roles and responsibilities of departmental committees to address common service delivery issues.</p><p>Integrated Services Committee (ISC):</p><ul><li>The ISC consists of a Director General or equivalent official from each department. It is chaired by the Director General, Corporate Finance, Planning and Systems of Department X. The ISC meets four times a year or more frequently as required.</li><li>The mandate of the ISC is to:

Risk
                is a key factor used to understand the complexity of the arrangement. Secretariat support for governance committees, if required, should be described.</li><li><strong><em>Roles and responsibilities of individual members</em></strong>:  Outline the expected contributions of individual members of the governance body and their commitments, including time, expertise, and resources.</li><li><strong><em>Roles and responsibilities of the governance body</em><em>as a whole</em></strong>:  Ensure that the parties agree on the mandate and decision-making authorities of each governance unit such as committees, sub-committees, or board.  Confirm the interactions and reporting relationships.  Since identifying and effectively
                managing risks is a major part of ensuring the health of a service arrangement and relationship, assessing risks and managing mitigation strategies are typically key responsibilities of a governance body.</li><li><strong><em>Relation of governance bodies to internal and external stakeholders such as service delivery managers and client groups</em></strong>: Articulate in the governance framework when and how governance units such as boards and committees will be expected to interact with stakeholders, including the means by which stakeholders affected by the
                service relationship can communicate comments and concerns to the governance body.</li><li><strong><em>Accountability</em></strong><em>: </em> Describe the specific accountabilities of both parties and any delegations of authority that are required to support the service. Accountability provisions may include an open and transparent performance management framework, explicit standards or performance expectations, external
                benchmarking, independent verification or audits, service management and client relationship management regimes and expectations, consequences (including financial consequences in the case of external service provider relationships), and dispute resolution processes.</li><li><strong><em>Decision-making processes</em></strong><em>: </em> For key governance decisions, specify the timeframes and mechanics of the decision-making process. Examples may include annual budget approvals, investment prioritization decisions, and decisions on strategic directions.</li><li><strong><em>Dispute resolution process</em></strong>:  Include provisions for the parties to resolve disputes in good faith. Also describe an agreed-upon escalation process should resolution prove elusive.

This may also include provisions specifying specific off-ramps
                should certain criteria be met or not met.

As long as the client receives the scope of services at the level of service outlined in the service agreement, day-to-day operations are generally not a concern. </p><p>In developing the service agreement, consider not only what happens when things go right, but also what will happen when things go wrong. Despite the best efforts of client and provider, things can go wrong, such as the late processing of a transaction due to staff shortages to a complete service disruption due to a disaster.</p><p>In all cases, plans are needed to ensure that issues are identified quickly, escalated to the right level for action, and that action is taken to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Communication between provider and client is critical.</p><p>Service managers and their service providers should discuss and identify the most likely and most critical issues that might arise, agree upon a resolution process, and incorporate these in their service agreement. Typical issues that can arise include:</p><ul><li>Day-to-day user issues such as slow system response times, to posting errors, system bugs, and report printing problems</li><li>Channel problems including web inaccessibility, slow call centre response times, lack of access to provider staff, and long in-person wait times</li><li>Transactions that do not comply with policy</li><li>Security or privacy breaches</li><li>Unexpected demand and/or volumes change</li><li>System outages</li><li>Specific regional issues</li><li>Any other major service disruption</li></ul><p>Depending on the nature and complexity of the service arrangement, the operational elements included in the service agreement may be few, particularly if it is an existing stable service and operating roles and responsibilities are clear.</p><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Important!</h4><p>When negotiating the privacy elements of a service agreement, it is highly recommended that service managers consult their privacy and legal experts.  In most cases, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) will be required for a new service arrangement.  Managers should consult the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18308"><em>Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment</em></a> and related policies, guides and tools.</p></div><h4>Operational Elements</h4><p>Depending upon the nature and complexity of the service arrangement, a service agreement may include provisions for some or all of the following operational elements:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Policies and signing authorities</em></strong><em>: </em> Clearly specify the policy suite and delegations of authority that will apply to transactions processed by the service, particularly any client-specific policies or delegations that are more restrictive than government-wide standards. Add specific signing or
                decision-making authorities to the agreement to cover special circumstances such as approval processes in project-based agreements. Include the process that will be used to escalate and resolve compliance issues should the provider receive a request to process a transaction that does not comply with policy or in-force delegations.</li><li><strong><em>Infrastructure</em>:</strong>  Include precise information as to the nature and quality of IT or any other equipment and/or asset involved and who will be responsible for providing, maintaining, and disposing of the equipment. This prevents confusion, omissions, and conflict as the service agreement is executed.</li><li><strong><em>Work sharing</em></strong>:  Clearly identify roles and responsibilities and document the impact on the service agreement's financial arrangements. Work-sharing arrangements can pose problems if not well thought-out and documented.</li><li><strong><em>Customer relationship management</em></strong>:  Document the customer relationship management and client-provider communications processes that will apply (e.g., service requests, resolution of user issues, billings, changes in scope, additional services, and newsletters) and the standards that will apply such as response time and resolution times. These provisions should
                also describe any annual planning or work plan processes supporting the management of the service agreement as a whole, such as change management and adjustments to scope. An annual risk assessment and mitigation plan may also be appropriate in complex arrangements.</li><li><strong><em>Privacy</em></strong>:  Specify any personal information held by the provider and the purpose for which it is collected, used, retained, and disclosed. Departments that provide services to or on behalf of another department will require access to data related to the delivery of those services, including personal
                information. When sharing of information is necessary and desirable, and is lawfully authorized, provision may be made within the service agreement.
<div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h4 class="alignCenter">Access to Information and Privacy Clause: An Example</h4><ul><li>Department X may request and keep copies or originals for the duration of the agreement where this is deemed necessary for operational purposes.</li><li>Department X will be considered to be the office of primary interest and any requests received under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/"><em>Access to Information Act</em></a> will either be transferred there for processing, along with a copy of the relevant records, or will only be processed by the service provider after consultation with Department X. This also applies to any reports and findings relative to the service. The service provider will also consult Department X before releasing any information subject to the agreement under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>.</li><li>It is understood that Department X owns all the data and files developed and used by the service provider in delivering the service on its behalf and that the original data and files will be returned to Department X upon conclusion of the agreement. However, the service provider may need to retain copies for as long as legal and operational requirements dictate. It may, for example, need to keep records responsive to a <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/"><em>Privacy Act</em></a> request for a minimum of two years.</li><li>The service provider, in cooperation with and at the cost of Department X, also undertakes to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for any new or increased collection, use, disclosure, or retention of personal information connected to the delivery of the service, update the PIA as required during the course of the agreement, and implement measures judged necessary to ensure the privacy of individuals in relation to the delivery of the service. </li></ul></div></li><li><strong><em>Security</em></strong>:  Outline appropriate security measures that will be undertaken to safeguard assets and information used in the delivery of the service and in accordance with Treasury Board guidelines. Security should be involved during the design process to be fully aware of any possible implications for the
                organization.</li><li><strong><em>Disclosure and use of information</em></strong>:  Where information or data may be a sensitive issue, address the roles and responsibilities of the involved parties with respect to the protection of sensitive information or data.</li><li><strong><em>Specific requirements</em></strong><em>: </em> Specify any unique operational provisions required to support a particular region or business requirement.</li><li><strong><em>Service disruptions / Business Continuity Plans</em></strong><em>: </em> Include requirements for the provider to have a Business Continuity Plan (<abbr title="Business Continuity Plan">BCP</abbr>) in place. The ability to quickly adapt and add new services in a time of emergency, such as to provide disaster assistance or the ability to continue to provide service during
                such a time is an important consideration for the service agreement.</li></ul><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h4 class="alignCenter">Checklist: Operational Elements of Service Agreements</h4><ul><li>Policies and Signing Authorities</li><li>Infrastructure</li><li>Work Sharing</li><li>Customer Relationship Management</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Security</li><li>Disclosure and Use of Information</li><li>Specific Requirements</li><li>Service Disruptions / Business Continuity Plans </li></ul></div></section><section anchor="5.4" title="Financial Arrangements"><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Important!</h4><p>For all types of arrangements, service providers should ensure that they do not enter into arrangements where the cost of doing so is greater than their available funds, be it appropriated funds, fees, or a mix thereof.  This requires a solid understanding of their underlying cost model, the scope of work to be delivered, and the cost of taking on the new business (including but not limited to incremental costs).</p></div><p>A number of <strong>financial arrangements</strong> are in use across the types of client/provider and collaborative service arrangements described in <a href="#cha3">Section 3</a>: Defining a Service Agreement. Different financial arrangements are more or less suited to particular types of arrangements. </p><p>In crafting an appropriate financial arrangement, the following principles should be applied to the extent possible:</p><ul><li>Provide stable multi-year funding for the service provider</li><li>Minimize administrative burden</li><li>Ensure cost transparency and clear accountability</li><li>Ensure adaptability and scalability</li><li>Provide incentives for desired behaviours particularly around service efficiency and providing value for money.</li><li>Accommodate funding for investments to keep services current to client needs and/or shifts in service delivery methods and channels.</li></ul><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Did You Know?</h4><p> “Funding” deals with how the service provider acquires the resources necessary to deliver a service or a client acquires the resources necessary to purchase a service.</p><p>“Cost” refers to the resources a service provider consumes to deliver a service.</p><p>“Price” or “Fee” refers to the amount charged to clients for the services they have purchased (typically incremental or full cost).</p></div><p>Departments must ensure that they have the legal mandate to provide a service before expending departmental appropriations in delivering or collaborating in the provision of the service. Departments that provide services must also have the authority to recover cost and to re-spend revenue, if applicable. Any cost recovery model used must be consistent with existing cost-recovery authorities and
        Treasury Board policy.</p><p>Agreement on the basic funding model is the first step in concluding a financial arrangement between a client and a provider. Three basic funding models, in various combinations and with some variation, cover most client/provider and collaborative service arrangements:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Fee-based model</em></strong>:  In this model, budgets remain with the client who pays for services based on actual usage. This model often requires detailed invoicing of services and can lead to disputes over volumes and actual services consumed versus the “quality” of those services. It requires that
                significantly more detail be built into a service level agreement and can be extremely complex to administer. The service provider typically has the expertise and capacity to support a defensible cost accounting regime capable of calculating the fee structure, particularly if services are offered in bundles and different fee structures are applied to different bundles. However, this
                model offers the greatest level of control over services the client will pay for, although it is also more difficult for the client to estimate the cost of these services for the year. Unless spending is very closely monitored, the client may end up paying more than budgeted for the year. Fee-based models are typically found in bilateral and shared service arrangements, arrangements
                with other jurisdictions, and may also be used in common service arrangements for optional service offerings.</li><li><strong><em>Pooled resources model</em></strong>:  In this model, the parties typically develop and agree on an annual scope of work for the service or project in question. The human resource requirements and costs of the annual plan are estimated and allocated usually based on their relative sizes (ability to pay) or use of the
                service. Participants make financial, human resources, or in-kind contributions as agreed by the parties. The program or project office is responsible for managing within the established budget. This model provides funding certainty for the year, is easy to administer, and clearly links contributions to an agreed-upon scope of work. The model requires diligent participant
                monitoring of progress against budget and tends to be less flexible to emerging or urgent demands that fall outside of the annual planning cycle. Pooled resource models are typically found in co-op sharing and cluster group arrangements.</li><li><strong><em>Appropriation-based model</em></strong>:  This is the
                simplest model to administer for both the client and service provider, but only pertains to service arrangements within the federal government and typically only to providers of common services. Appropriations are allocated to the service provider on an annual basis. The service provider has stability of funding, but not a great deal of flexibility for adapting to changes in client
                demand. The ability to invest in service enhancements is typically constrained and over time, it is possible the service will become stale relative to evolving client requirements. Clients do not need to worry about the cost of these services, but they tend to have limited say in the scope or quality of the services delivered. Over time, it can be difficult to tie the
                appropriation back to the value of the service being delivered to a specific client. Since there is no direct link between cost and service outputs, there tends to be very little cost transparency. Savings over time remain with the service provider, not the client departments. Appropriation-based models are typically found in common services and, in some limited cases, could be
                used for certain areas of a shared service arrangement.</li></ul><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Important!</h4><p>When negotiating the cost recovery elements of a service agreement, it is highly recommended that managers consult their finance group.</p></div><p>In general, as client control over the funding of the service increases, the complexity to administer the funding also increases. For example, a flat fee based on estimated annual usage would tend to be easier to administer and would provide a more predicable and stable flow of funding. However, there is little connection between user behaviour and fees charged. A fee for service
            model that is calculated on actual transaction volumes would be complex to administer but could be tailored to drive desired user behaviours. Such a model would also be more adaptable and scalable and would be more cost transparent. Based on lessons learned from other public and private sector organizations, most organizations are moving away from “detailed” invoicing for
        services based on usage, to models that are simpler to administer. </p><p>It is not unusual to see mixed funding models that try to take advantage of the best features of the three noted above. For example, in shared service models in the private sector and in provincial governments, some core functions are funded through a fixed appropriation while volume-dependent functions are funded through fee-based cost recovery. The shared service may negotiate a
        service arrangement with a client for the year based on a client's service requirements for “core” and any “additional” services. Service volumes could be negotiated within a maximum and minimum range. Clients that exceed the maximum would have to pay an additional amount based on an agreed-to rate structure. If a client does not reach the minimum, there
        could be an option to receive a refund or to carry over the unused portion for the next year. Investments to keep the service current could be managed on a pooled basis or through an investment premium included in the cost recovery calculation.</p><p>Financial arrangements are the most critical aspect of building a win-win relationship. They are very difficult to get right and modifications may be required to accommodate changing conditions. It is very important that flexibility and adaptability be built into the service agreement to ensure that parties can adapt the financial arrangement to maintain a strong relationship.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h4 class="alignCenter">Service Bundles: Typical Fee Structures</h4><p>Fee structures typically reflect how services are consumed.  As a result, it is not unusual to see different fee structures attached to the different service bundles described in <a href="#cha4">Section 4</a>. The most common fee structures for each bundle are:</p><p><strong><em>Basic service package:  </em></strong>In a cost recovery model, the fee structure is typically based on a client's expected volumes for a period of time (usually a year) by a standard rate that reflects cost recovery.  In an arrangement where the participants pool resources, the fee is based on an allocation of the total budget based on the client's relative size or transaction volumes.</p><p><strong><em>Supplementary services package:  </em></strong>This package is based on expected client volumes per additional service by a standard rate that reflects cost recovery.</p><p><strong><em>Optional service extensions:  </em></strong>Most optional service extensions involve incremental advisory services with a fee structure based on expected usage multiplied by a standard per diem rate that reflects cost recovery.</p><p><strong><em>Project services:  </em></strong>Generally a firm, all-inclusive price is used (for example, per diem rate multiplied by estimated effort) plus estimated materials / travel costs or a fee that covers time and material (for example, per diem rate multiplied by actual effort) plus actual materials.</p><p><strong><em>Service level extensions:  </em></strong>Where there is a specific output involved, such as additional reports, a standard rate is normally multiplied by a metric per output (for example, fee per report).  Where there is no specific output (for example, extended help desk hours), a standard rate x is often multiplied by the expected volume.</p><p><strong><em>Unique services:  </em></strong>Full cost for the creation and operation of the unique service, function, or feature.</p></div><h4>Financial Arrangement Elements</h4><p>Depending upon the complexity of the service arrangement, a service agreement may include provisions for some or all of the following financial arrangement elements:        </p><ul><li><p><strong><em>Funding model</em></strong><em>: </em> Ensure the funding model to be used as the basis for the financial arrangement is clearly described in the service agreement. A clear description of the model used, whether it is fee-based, pooled, appropriation-based, or another mix, should be included. It is essential that both
                parties agree on the desired results and behaviours they wish to encourage in order to determine the best funding model and the basis on which the price or fee is being determined.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h5 class="alignCenter" style="font-style:normal">Terms of Payment: An Example</h5><p>Department X undertakes a specific research project on behalf of Department Y.</p><p><strong>Terms of Payment</strong></p><p>Payment by Department Y will be made upon receipt and verification of periodic claims for payment.  Claims will be made on delivery of specified deliverables or as directed by the Steering Committee. The estimate of Department X financial requirements is based upon a budget forecast that is satisfactory in form and detail to Department Y and is set out in the Project Cost Projections. Final payment will be made following receipt of all the deliverables identified in Schedule A.</p></div></li><li><strong><em>Fee structure</em></strong>:  Outline charges for the service provided and establish how those charges will be determined. Discussions should focus on the nature of the services being provided, how those services are bundled and offered to the client, and the most suitable price or fee structure for the particular type of
                service or bundle (see box).  Baseline assessments of client demand for services, if possible, will allow the parties to establish an agreement that accurately accounts for the client's needs and constraints.  Include provisions or a process to periodically review and if necessary, adjust the fee structure. Because the fee represents a transfer of resources between the parties,
                negotiations need to address the exact process, terms, and conditions that apply to determining the fee such as cost transparency and resource sharing. A fee links resources consumed to outcomes achieved.</li><li><p><strong><em>Resource pooling arrangements</em></strong>:  Document how the scope of work will be determined and costs accumulated. Include a prioritization process whereby participants agree on the scope of work and total budget. The formula for determining each participant's contribution should be included. The costing
                approach may also be discussed.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h5 class="alignCenter" style="font-style:normal">Resource Pooling Arrangement: An Example</h5><p>Department X will provide, on a secondment basis, a full-time resource (Individual Y) for a period of twelve (12) months, starting on a date to be determined and agreed to in a secondment agreement.</p><p>The duration of this secondment may be amended by mutual agreement. Department X agrees to cover the salary and related costs including travel and training for Individual Y during the secondment period.</p><p>Department X will also provide statistical advisory services and support to the project team in conducting the Feasibility Study on a cost-recovery basis as requested. It is anticipated that this will involve between 5 to 10 person-days at the EC-07 level, between May 21 and August 25.</p></div></li><li><strong><em>People and in-kind contributions</em></strong>:  Document any commitments for resource transfers and in-kind contributions. This typically happens in resource pooling arrangements but can also occur in fee-based models. It is possible to have a service agreement price of “nil” dollars. Careful documentation of all resource transfers and in-kind
                contributions, such as use of office space, will clarify among the parties the source and nature of the resources contributed to the agreement. If there are minimum requirements for staff, such as secret clearance or accommodation, spell these out.</li><li><strong><em>Incentive pricing</em></strong>:  Provide an incentive through your fee structures for desired behaviours. For example, to encourage use of lower-cost channels, fees may be less for accessing a service online rather than in-person. To reduce the number of customizations, fees for a custom report may be significantly
                greater than for a similar standard report. The parties should determine the behaviours they wish to encourage or discourage to make overall service delivery more efficient and effective, and incorporate appropriate incentive pricing into the service agreement.</li><li><strong><em>Investments in service enhancements</em></strong>:  Articulate how and through what means the services in question will be maintained and upgraded to current client requirements and how those investments will be funded. An annual investment planning and prioritization process should be articulated in the service
                agreement. Funding for service enhancements are typically managed through prorated contributions in the case of a pooled resources model or are built into the costs supporting the cost recovery fee calculations.</li><li><strong><em>Cost transparency</em></strong><em>:</em>  Identify all costs in the early planning phases to ensure a sound basis for negotiating an acceptable resource level. This may include a right to audit or review the calculation and accumulation of costs.</li><li><strong><em>Variances and adjustments</em></strong>:  Anticipate the types of changes the service agreement may be required to address, such as changes in scope, quality, and volume. Embed appropriate procedures for dealing with variances and adjustments within the service agreement so that each party has flexibility to respond to changing
                conditions.</li><li><p><strong><em>Contingent funding</em></strong>:  If the delivery or consumption of a service is contingent on either the client or provider obtaining a funding approval through an internal process, Treasury Board submission, or a Memorandum to Cabinet, this should be noted and appropriate off-ramps should be provided if the necessary funding is not obtained.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h5 class="alignCenter" style="font-style:normal">Contingent Funding: An Example</h5><p>Department A delivers services to Canadians on behalf of a program administered by Department B.</p><p>The agreed upon financial arrangements will take effect upon Department A obtaining Vote Netting authority to charge and re-spend, and will be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year in which Department A obtains the Vote Netting authority.</p></div></li><li><strong><em>Consequences</em></strong><em>: </em> In service provider arrangements with other jurisdictions, financial penalties for late delivery or falling short of service levels may be used. Where consequences are to be used, clearly spell out when and how penalties will arise and how the penalty will be calculated.</li><li><strong><em>Settlement arrangements</em></strong>:  Be clear about processes and mechanisms that will be used to settle any charges, including billing arrangements, payment schedules, late payments, and disputed charges. Promote the prompt and accurate settlement of accounts. Consider including interdepartmental settlement /
                financial codes to which charges are to be billed in the service level agreement. The Treasury Board Secretariat (<abbr title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</abbr>) <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12251"><em>Guide to Costing</em></a> also identifies principles and best practices associated with costing services.

Together, outputs and outcomes demonstrate how well the service arrangement has achieved its objectives. The collection of performance information is critical to ensuring continuous improvement of service delivery.</p><p>Research and experience indicate that establishing and monitoring performance against service standards and measuring client satisfaction are two of the most valuable activities an organization can undertake to promote service excellence. Service standards document a provider's commitment to the level of performance clients can expect under normal circumstances. Client satisfaction
        measures a client's actual and perceived assessment of the quality of the service received against their expectations.</p><p>Service standards and client satisfaction measurement are key components of a client-centred approach. Service standards and client satisfaction measures for services to <em>external</em> clients have been in use since the 1990s.  In a client-centred approach, internal services should also be designed around client needs and expectations within fiscal constraints and thus standards
        and measures are equally applicable. Under the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12025"><em>Common Services Policy</em></a>, all common service organizations (<abbr title="Business Continuity Plan">CSO</abbr>s) are accountable for developing, in consultation with clients, meaningful and visible standards. The use of standards and performance reporting against those standards can be a valuable addition to a service relationship.</p><p>A service agreement should document service standards and client satisfaction measurement procedures for the client of the service, as well as performance measurement procedures.</p><div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Did You Know?</h4><ul><li>The TB <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25750"><em>Guideline on Service Standards</em></a> provides detailed guidance and advice on the processes and considerations involved in establishing and monitoring service standards.</li><li>The <a href="http://www.iccs-isac.org/en/">Institute for Citizen-Centred Service</a> provides a range of useful information on client satisfaction measurement</li></ul></div><h4>Performance Elements</h4><p>Depending upon the complexity of the service arrangement, a service agreement may include provisions for some or all of the following performance elements:</p><ul><li><p><strong><em>Performance targets</em></strong>:  Specific performance targets should be established in the service agreement and should cover both service standards and client satisfaction measures. Depending on the nature of the service involved, performance targets may be expressed in terms of volumes per period of time, cost savings,
                response times, expected results, service levels, outputs, outcomes, or qualitative benefits realized. Targets should be measurable at a reasonable cost. Targets should be comparable to various cost, service level, and satisfaction baseline measures to clearly document the level of improvement achieved over time.</p><p>Targets should
                provide meaningful information about the service to both the client and the provider and, ideally the continuous improvement of service performance. To this end, targets should address the client's overall experience from start to finish, rather than isolated steps in a process, particularly where more than one organization is involved in delivering the service. Many factors can
                affect decisions about specific service standards and client satisfaction measurement activities. Specific operational metrics such as tracking how long an application takes to be assessed or processed can help the parties determine appropriate service standards and allow them to monitor specific parts of the process in more detail.</p></li><li><strong><em>Performance measurement and reporting</em></strong>:  The performance measurement and reporting regime for a service agreement should be structured to ensure the information available to participants is meaningful, timely, impartial, and consistent with standardized government reporting, including input into the Management
                Accountability Framework and any legislative and policy-based reporting requirements, such as the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18218"><em>Policy on Management, Resources and Results Structures</em></a>. Communication of performance measurement results to clients (end-users and stakeholders) and staff demonstrates transparency, accountability, and a
                commitment to quality service.</li><li><strong><em>Tying performance to Performance Management Agreements (<abbr title="Performance Management Agreements">PMA</abbr>s):</em></strong> Depending on the scope of the initiative, the success of a significant service relationship codified as a <abbr title="Performance Management Agreements">PMA</abbr>s goal of a senior executive should be considered. Performance objectives could then cascade down to the <abbr title="Performance Management Agreements">PMA</abbr>s of responsible individuals in their department. Tying service relationship goals
                into <abbr title="Performance Management Agreements">PMA</abbr>s will encourage the correct level of management attention which is often a prerequisite for success.</li><li><strong><em>Identifying responsibility and processes for monitoring service standards and client satisfaction</em></strong><em>: </em> To promote clarity, rigour, and continuity requires clear documentation of who is responsible for monitoring performance and satisfaction, together with approaches, mechanisms, and measures for assessments, how
                frequently standards and satisfaction will be measured, and what reporting and follow-up will look like. Methodologies should be appropriate to the service, the channel, and the end-user and stakeholder. Operational issues and items can generally be assessed through standard quality tools, including cause and effect and fault-tree analyses. Processes should be proportional to the
                service.
                
				<div class="floatRight width33 highlightBox"><h5 class="alignCenter" style="font-style:normal">Important!</h5><p>Client satisfaction measurement is considered public opinion research and as such managers should consult the TB <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12316"><em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em></a> and associated <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16491"><em>Procedures for Planning and Contracting Public Opinion Research</em></a>. Public opinion research is a mandatory common service and as such, departments must coordinate their planning, contracting, and implementation of their research requirements with <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.</p></div></li><li><strong><em>Evaluation and reporting frequency</em></strong><em>: </em> Measuring performance, including service standards and client satisfaction, on a regular basis informs future action and provides the basis for ongoing improvement. A formal schedule for reporting on short-, mid-, and long-term performance is typically included in each
                service agreement with separate schedules prepared for each <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr> negotiated in accordance with any policy-based reporting requirements. Regular measurement and reporting of client satisfaction and client input through surveys or focus groups allow the parties to monitor progress and make adjustments as required. The frequency and nature of client satisfaction and input measures should be
                outlined in the agreement.</li><li><strong><em>Benchmark the service delivery process</em></strong>:  Comparisons of the performance of the service covered by the agreement with the performance of similar operations helps participants identify strengths and weaknesses and promotes improved processes and outcomes. Internally, benchmarking can also be used to assess changes
                in the performance of service delivery by the department over time.</li><li><strong><em>Performance of the arrangement</em></strong>:  A key role of most governance bodies is to periodically evaluate the performance of the service delivery arrangement, from both the effectiveness of the arrangement (e.g., reviewing performance measures and client feedback), and the effectiveness of the governance processes and
                structures to review how the relationship has operated and determine whether it is still the best way to do business.</li><li><strong><em>Risk reporting</em></strong><em>: </em> Ongoing monitoring of risk and mitigation of risks is part of evaluating the arrangement and includes a link to change control.</li><li><strong><em>Continuous improvement</em></strong><em>: </em> Although performance measurement and reporting can support continuous improvement, it doesn't just happen. Specific processes should be established to identify and implement improvements and to assess their effectiveness as reflected in better service performance. A
                continuous improvement commitment and process should be established in the service agreement. In some cases, targets are modified each year to reflect an expectation of improved efficiencies through continuous improvements.</li><li><strong><em>Consequences</em></strong><em>:</em>  Where there are specific financial consequences of non-performance, such as not achieving a performance target, the performance measurement and reporting process may have significant consequences for the provider and could lead to disputes that affect the quality of the relationship. It is
                important that any measure that may be used to assess penalties be as objective as possible. The measures, how they are to be calculated, and the measurement process itself should be clearly spelled out in the agreement.</li></ul><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h4 class="alignCenter">Checklist: Performance Elements of Service Agreements</h4><ul><li>Performance Targets</li><li>Performance Measurement and Reporting</li><li>Tying Performance to Performance Management Agreements (<abbr title="Performance Management Agreements">PMA</abbr>s)</li><li>Identifying Responsibility and Processes for Monitoring Service Standards and Client Satisfaction</li><li>Evaluation and Reporting Frequency</li><li>Benchmarking the Service Delivery Process</li><li>Performance of the Arrangement</li><li>Risk Reporting</li><li>Continuous Improvement</li><li>Consequences</li></ul></div></section><section anchor="5.6" title="Implementation"><p>All of the activities and tasks required to implement a new service should be considered in the development of a service agreement. </p><p>In many ways, the successful execution of a service relationship depends on the care with which the details of the implementation are articulated and carried out.

        and execution should be funded, resourced, managed, and tracked.</p><p>Implementation efforts are highly dependent on the complexity of the service involved and the collaborative arrangement in question.

Conclusion"><p>When departments negotiate arrangements to work together or when they work individually to provide better services for internal and external clients, service agreements provide a means to promote the delivery of cost effective client-centred, well-managed service. They help reinforce accountabilities when one department provides service to or on behalf of another department by ensuring
roles and responsibilities are clearly outlined and deputy heads have the correct information to discharge their accountabilities. Service agreements also increase the quality and consistency of service arrangements throughout the Government of Canada through the use of common structures, approaches, and, to some degree, processes. Together, these activities help enhance the
management of service delivery and promote efficiency and effectiveness.</p></chapter></chapters><appendices><appendix anchor="A" title="Appendix A. Summary of Service Agreements Elements"><h3>Introduction</h3><div class="floatRight width50 highlightBox"><h4 class="alignCenter">Note!</h4><p>In some cases, the same element may be found in more than one type of agreement. If so, they should be at differing levels of detail. For example, a high-level description of scope may be found in a Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) and perhaps is as simple as the name of the service (for example, Application Hosting). The accompanying Service Level Agreement (<abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>) for the same service may, however, would provide much greater detail on the scope of the Application Hosting service being provided, including details about the applications being hosted, the technical environment, supporting help desk services, business continuity provisions, and related service levels of performance targets. The provisions in the various agreements should complement one another.  Overlap and duplication should be avoided to minimize the risk of conflicting interpretations between the various provisions.</p></div><p>The following table provides a list of elements typically found in service agreements and indicates, for simple, medium, or complex service arrangements, in which type of service agreement those elements are typically found. </p><p>Depending on the scope of the service relationship and the type of service arrangement, some items may not be applicable. For example, if the service in question will be billed on a cost recovery basis, there may be no requirement to discuss the pooling of resources.</p><p>In the table, for a simple or medium arrangement, certain elements are not included. This is based on the assumption that the arrangement is simple enough that these elements are not necessary. If, in developing a simple <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, it is felt that some or all of these types of elements are indeed required, it is likely that the arrangement itself should be considered medium or complex
        rather than simple or medium. The choice of service agreements (<abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, <abbr title="Master Agreement">MA</abbr>, and/or <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>) would be governed accordingly.</p><h3>Summary of Service Agreement Elements</h3><table class="rpp widthFull"><caption class="alignLeft"><strong>Basic Elements</strong></caption><tr><th rowspan="2" id="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c1" class="alignTopLeft width70"><strong>Element</strong></th><th id="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c2" class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Simple</strong></th><th colspan="2" id="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c3" class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Medium</strong></th><th colspan="3" id="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c5" class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Complex</strong></th></tr><tr><th id="t-ifmd-g1-r2-c2" class="alignTopCenter" headers="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c2"><strong><abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr></strong></th><th id="t-ifmd-g1-r2-c3" class="alignTopCenter" headers="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c3"><strong><abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr></strong></th><th id="t-ifmd-g1-r2-c4" class="alignTopCenter" headers="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c3"><strong><abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr></strong></th><th id="t-ifmd-g1-r2-c5" class="alignTopCenter" headers="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c5"><strong><abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr></strong></th><th id="t-ifmd-g1-r2-c6" class="alignTopCenter" headers="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c5"><strong><abbr title="Master Agreement">MA</abbr></strong></th><th id="t-ifmd-g1-r2-c7" class="alignTopCenter" headers="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c5"><strong><abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr></strong></th></tr><tr><td id="t-ifmd-g1-r3-c1" class="alignTopLeft" headers="t-ifmd-g1-r1-c1">
