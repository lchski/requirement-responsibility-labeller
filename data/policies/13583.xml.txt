shall continue until the end of the month in which the employee would have reached maximum age or length of service.</p><p>(c) For each month, after the month in which the employee would have reached maximum age or length of service, an income

total of any statutory entitlements payable to or in respect of the spouses and children of the employee in respect of that 
month.</p><p>6.2 Where the survivors are two eligible spouses, the income benefit for each spouse, subject to Section 6.3, shall be

the income benefit for the eligible child shall be apportioned in the same proportion as the total statutory entitlements 
which are payable to or on behalf of this eligible child, are to the total statutory entitlements referred to in section 6.1(a) 
or 6.1(c) as the case may be.</p><p>6.4 Where the survivors are a spouse with a child or children and the spouse subsequently dies or otherwise ceases to 
be eligible, a payment to the eligible child or children shall be made under the provisions of section 7.</p><p>Eligible children only</p><p>7.1 Where there is no eligible spouse and the employee is survived by an eligible child or children, the child or children 
shall be entitled to an income benefit determined as follows:</p><p>(a) for each month, following the month in which the employee's death occurred, or in which the spouse died or ceased 
to be eligible;</p><div class="indent1"><p>(i) the child shall be paid an income benefit under the plan in an amount such that the total amount of statutory entitlements

  of the employee in respect of that month;</p><p>(ii) where there is more than one eligible child, and subject to section 7.3(b) an income benefit shall be paid under 
  the plan in an amount by which the net pay of the employee in respect of that month exceeds the total amount of statutory 
  entitlements payable to or in respect of the children and in respect of that month, such amount being apportioned equally 
  amongst the eligible children.</p></div><p>7.2 For as long as the child or children remain eligible for an income benefit under the plan, payment of the amounts 
determined in section 7.1 shall continue until the end of the month in which the employee would have reached maximum age

benefit shall be paid to or in respect of the eligible child or children in an amount equal to:</p><p>(a) in the case of one child, an amount such that the total amount of statutory entitlements and the income benefit payable 
hereunder to or in respect of that child and in respect of that month is equal to 50 percent of the net pension of the employee 
in respect of that month; or</p><p>(b) where there is more than one child, the amount by which the net pension of the employee in respect of that month 
exceeds the total of statutory entitlements payable to or in respect of the children and in respect of that month, such 
amount being apportioned equally amongst the eligible children.</p><p>7.4 Income benefits payable in respect of any child under the plan shall be paid to the person or agency to whom benefits 
are payable in respect of that child under the Government Employees Compensation Act or where that Act no longer applies, 
are payable under the Terms and Conditions of the Pension Act. Such recipient shall be accountable for the disposition of 
the income benefit in accordance with law.</p><p>General</p><p>8.1 In no case shall the income benefits payable under the plan be in an amount which would cause the total benefits 
payable, including statutory entitlements in respect of the survivors, to exceed the net pay or net pension, as the case 
may be, which the employee would have received.</p><p>8.2 The plan administrator shall ensure that overpayments are duly recovered.</p><p>Assignment of payments</p><p>9. Payments made under the plan are not assignable.</p><p>Workers' compensation</p><p>10. Payments made under the plan are in the nature of workmen's compensation.</p><p>Payments</p><p>11. (a) Benefits payable under the plan shall be paid monthly in arrears and shall continue until the end of the month 
during which the recipient dies or otherwise ceases to be eligible.</p><p>(b) Where monthly payments are twenty dollars or less, the frequency of payments will be on a quarterly, semi-annual, 
or annual basis; whichever is determined by the plan administrator to be the most administratively practicable.</p><p>Condition</p><p>12. As a condition of the payment of benefits under the plan, an eligible spouse, or child, or children or other person 
being paid benefits on behalf of an eligible child or children shall provide or shall authorize the plan administrator to 
obtain such information as is required to properly administer the terms of the plan.</p><p>Complaint settlement</p><p>13. (a) A surviving spouse or child who is dissatisfied with the amount of payment determined by the plan administrator, 
or who has been refused a payment or whose payments have been discontinued by the plan administrator, may lodge a complaint 
in writing with the Commission.</p><p>(b) The Commission on receipt of the complaint shall, without delay and in a summary way: review the complaint; reach a
