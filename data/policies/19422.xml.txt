<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><doc title="Framework for the Management of Risk" documentID="19422" versionID="1" language="en" space="preserve" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="PolicyInstrumentSchema.xsd"><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="1. Effective Date"><p>The Framework for the Management of Risk (the Framework) is effective as of August 27, 2010.</p><p>The Framework will be supported by learning resources, which will replace the Treasury Board 
<em>Integrated Risk Management Framework</em> (2001) and the <em>Integrated Risk Management Implementation Guide</em> (2004)<em>. </em></p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Context"><p>In a dynamic and complex public sector context, risk management plays a significant
role in strengthening government capacity to recognize, understand, accommodate
and capitalize on new challenges and opportunities.  Effective risk management
equips federal government organizations to respond actively to change and
uncertainty by using risk-based information to enable more effective decision-making. 
In turn, increased capacity and demonstrated ability to assess, communicate and
manage risk builds trust and confidence, both within the government and with
the public.</p><p>For the Government of Canada to continually improve the way it delivers services to
Canadians, it is important that its management regime fosters flexibility, seeks
opportunity and focuses on results.  Integral to such a regime is effective
risk management. The principles-based approach to risk management articulated
in this Framework provides the flexibility to departments and agencies to tailor
management solutions to their mandate and objectives. In addition, it enables
strategic, risk-informed oversight and less transactional involvement of the Treasury
Board and Treasury Board Secretariat in supporting department and agency
management initiatives.  </p><p>In
order to foster this type of risk-informed culture and capacity to fully
realize performance improvements within federal organizations, strengthened
risk management approaches must be reflected across all business practices. 
Failure to effectively manage risks can result in increased program costs and
missed opportunities, which can compromise program outcomes, and ultimately
public trust.  In contrast, sound risk management is fundamental to effective
public administration as it can lead to a more effective, results-based, and
high performance government. Key terminology related to risk management is
defined in 
<a href="#appA">Appendix A</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Linkages to Other Treasury Board Instruments"><p>As one of the three
core frameworks guiding Treasury Board policies and management instruments, the
<em>Framework for the Management of Risk</em> provides Deputy Heads with
principles to embed risk management as a critical element in all areas of work,
at all levels of their organization.  The risk management principles outlined
in this Framework complement the conceptual model for policy renewal set out in
the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13616">Foundation
Framework for Treasury Board Policies</a> as well as the considerations for
managing compliance identified in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17151">Framework for the
Management of Compliance</a>.</p><p>The <em>Framework for
the Management of Risk</em> outlines the risk management principles to guide Deputy
Heads in the effective management of their organizations in all areas of work,
including policy and program implementation. These principles apply to all
Treasury Board policies, including the individual policies of the renewed
Treasury Board Policy Suite, and guide the Treasury Board Secretariat in its
policy development, enabling and oversight roles. These three core Frameworks
are put in place to enable more effective management of federal organizations
by promoting accountability, transparency and supporting risk-informed decision-making,
which is recognized as a leading management practice.</p><p>Specifically, the principles contained in the <em>Framework for the Management of Risk</em> have
shaped the design and choice of implementation approaches for particular Treasury Board policies 
(e.g. Policy on Internal Audit, Policy on Internal
Control, Policy on Transfer Payments, Policy on Investment Planning), and will
continue to be refined and adjusted based on emerging trends and lessons
learned from their implementation.</p><p>Key linkages with other
Treasury Board instruments are outlined in 
<a href="#appB">Appendix B</a>. The current list of
Treasury Board policies can be found on the Secretariat's web site.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Purpose"><p>The purpose of this Framework is to
provide guidance to Deputy Heads on the implementation of effective risk
management practices at all levels of their organization. This will support
strategic priority setting and resource allocation, informed decisions with
respect to risk tolerance, and improved results.</p><p>To achieve this
purpose, the Framework provides principles and guidance for Deputy Heads to
consider in their role as leaders of sound risk management practices and risk
management integration within their organizations. For the purposes of the
Framework, departments and agencies are those defined in section 2 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial
Administration Act</a></em>. </p><p>Effective
risk management, supported by this Framework, and associated learning resources,
will enable Deputy Heads to:</p><ul><li>Identify and explain different types of risks at all levels of their organization and how they can 
	be managed;</li><li>Provide guidance on setting risk tolerance levels and making decisions informed by considerations 
	of risk and mitigation strategies, including who should be involved; </li><li>Support learning opportunities in their organization, including informal and formal risk management 
	practices that respond to the needs and culture of their organizations; </li><li>Lead by example by embedding risk management principles and practices in the management of their 
	organization; and</li><li>Align their risk management practices with other Treasury Board management practices and policies.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Principles"><p>The following risk management principles inform the development of, and apply to, all Treasury Board 
policy instruments, some of which have embedded risk management requirements specific to their policy coverage.  These
principles are grounded in federal public service values and ethics, and guide and underpin effective risk 
management across the federal government. The principles support Deputy Heads, and their departments and 
agencies, in taking risk-informed approaches to management decisions and in demonstrating and verifying that
risks are successfully identified, assessed and managed within their respective organizations.</p><p>To that end, effective risk management in the federal government should:</p><ul><li>support government-wide decision-making and priorities as well as the achievement of organizational 
	objectives and outcomes, while maintaining public confidence;</li><li>be tailored and responsive to the organization's external and internal context including its 
	mandate, priorities, organizational risk culture, risk management capacity, and partner and stakeholder 
	interests;</li><li>add value as a key component of decision-making, business planning, resource allocation and
	operational management;</li><li>achieve a balance between the level of risk responses and established controls and
	support for flexibility and innovation to improve performance and outcomes;</li><li>be transparent, inclusive, integrated and systematic; and</li><li>continuously improve the culture, capacity and capability of risk management in federal
	organizations.</li></ul><p>In addition, Treasury Board policy instruments and associated oversight activities are aligned with the 
above and also guided by the following principles: </p><ul><li>Treasury Board policy instruments should target risks linked to achieving federal government 
	management objectives;</li><li>these instruments should be proportional to the degree of impact and likelihood of the risks 
	identified; and</li><li>oversight should be adjusted to correspond to an organization's demonstrated capacity for managing 
	risk, where circumstances permit.</li></ul><p>Learning resources to support the practical application of these principles by departments and agencies, 
including the 2010 <em>Guide to Integrated Risk Management</em>, are available on the Treasury Board
Secretariat's web site.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Roles and Responsibilities"><section anchor="6.1" title="Deputy Heads"><p>Deputy Heads are responsible for managing their organization's risks by leading the implementation of 
effective risk management practices, both formal and informal. In doing so, Deputy Heads are encouraged to 
apply the principles outlined above in section 5. </p><p>A key role of the Deputy Head is to ensure that risk management principles and practices are understood 
and integrated into the various activities of their organization.  Deputy Heads are also responsible for 
monitoring risk management practices in their organizations, as well as considering risks that arise when 
partnering with organizations within and external to the federal public service.  This includes ensuring 
that issues affecting the organization's risk management approach, whether identified through assessments or 
internal and external monitoring, are examined, reviewed and addressed effectively. </p><p>In addition, Deputy Heads play an important role in creating a learning environment that promotes 
continuous improvement in risk management competencies and capacity within their organization. Through their 
leadership, Deputy Heads foster a risk-informed organizational culture that supports risk-informed 
decision-making, enables dialogue on risk tolerance, focuses on results and enables the consideration of both opportunity and innovation.</p></section><section anchor="6.2" title="Treasury Board and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (Secretariat)"><p>A key element of the Treasury Board's role, as well as the role of its Secretariat, is to encourage 
management excellence in government through leadership, guidance, monitoring, review and oversight, 
pursuant to the authority given in the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial
Administration Act</a>.</em></p><p>To fulfill this role in the domain of risk management, the Treasury Board and the Secretariat provide 
guidance, tools and expertise to support departments and agencies in implementing a risk-informed approach 
to management.  This also includes performing a leadership role by sharing information and fostering good practices on risk
management and risk-informed approaches.</p><p>The Secretariat also monitors and assesses departmental and agency performance on
risk management through such means as the Management Accountability Framework,
and reviews of internal and external audits.  These assessments may be used to
inform discussions between the Secretary of the Treasury Board and Deputy Heads.</p><p>Evidence
that a federal department or agency has effective risk management practices in
place may lead to Treasury Board and Secretariat oversight being adjusted to an
organization's capacity for managing risk, where circumstances permit. Conversely,
ineffective risk management may lead to additional controls and oversight.  Where
necessary, the Secretariat may encourage deputy heads to
undertake appropriate remedial measures in support of their responsibilities
for the monitoring of risk management within their organization.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Enquiries"><p>All
