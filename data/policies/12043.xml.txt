Effective date"><p>This directive is effective as of November 1, 2006.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>This directive applies to all departments within the meaning of section 2 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act</a></em>, unless specific acts 
or regulations override it. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>The Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy 
on Management of Real Property</a></em> defines the performance expectations for the management of real property 
throughout its life cycle, including obligations associated with the disposal phase. The policy requires deputy heads 
to ensure a disposal by sale or transfer is completed in conformance with this directive.</p><p>Of particular importance to the sale or transfer of real property are the policy requirements to: undertake a performance 
assessment of the functionality and utilization of real property and to develop disposal strategies. These strategies, 
which are partly based on the findings of the performance assessment, will include plans for the disposal or relinquishment 
of real property that is no longer required for program purposes and therefore will not be retained by the custodian 
or occupied by the tenant.</p><p>This directive only addresses the obligations of custodians to dispose of surplus real property by sale or transfer. 
Other disposals, such as easements, leases and licences, are addressed in the
Guide to Management of Real Property, 
as are the relinquishment of real property by tenants, demolitions and other activities of the disposal phase.</p><p>Surplus real property is sold or transferred following an established process tailored to the characteristics of 
the surplus property, i.e., whether it is routine or strategic. In general, routine surplus real properties are properties, 
or a portfolio of properties with lesser value that can be sold easily without any substantial investment. These properties 
are normally sold in their "as is" state on the open market by the custodian, its agent (Public Works and Government 
Services Canada), or a private sector firm. </p><p>Strategic surplus real properties are properties or portfolios of properties with potential for significantly enhanced 
value, those that are highly sensitive, or a combination of these factors. Because of the complexity associated with 
these properties, they may require innovative efforts and a comprehensive management approach to move them into the 
market. Canada Lands Company CLC Limited, as the government's disposal agent, disposes of these selected surplus properties 
through a strategic disposal process.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.

Purpose"><p>The sale or transfer of surplus real property has potentially higher risk than activities during other life cycle 
phases of the management of real property because of the sensitivity or value associated with many of the properties, 
the numerous diverse stakeholder interests and the importance of horizontal cooperation. This directive is intended 
to address the issues and ensure that sales or transfers of surplus real property provide for:</p><ul><li>a whole of government perspective;</li><li>efficiency, equity and transparency in transactions;</li><li>best value to the Canadian taxpayer;</li><li>consideration of the interests of communities, including official language minority communities, and other levels of government; and</li><li>the fulfillment of any legal obligations with respect to Aboriginal groups.</li></ul><p>This directive is issued pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration 
Act</a></em>, subsections 7(1), 9(1.1), 9(2) and the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-8.4/index.html">Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act</a></em>, 
subsection 16(4).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Directive requirements"><p>6.1 Custodians shall conclude the sale or transfer of properties within three years of formal notification of the 
property being surplus to program requirements. The consideration received for the property must be justified in 
relation to market value, determined in accordance with 
the Treasury Board <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12045"><em>Appraisal 
and Estimates Standard for Real Property</em></a>.</p><p>6.2 Custodians shall categorize surplus properties as either routine or strategic. All surplus properties are considered 
routine unless they meet at least one of the following criteria, which qualifies them as strategic:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>the size or value of the property, or of a portfolio of properties, is significant enough to affect local markets 
	negatively if its integration into the market is not managed;</li><li>the value of the property, or properties within a portfolio, can be increased significantly (e.g., through 
	subdivision, rezoning, investment or pre-sale development);</li><li>a partnership with another level of government, the private sector or other party may offer the best mechanism 
	to realize either the inherent value of a particular property or portfolio of properties or the greatest benefits 
	to the government beyond the financial return; or</li><li>sensitive policy issues exist, including the potential for a substantial gain by a party other than the federal 
	government.</li></ol><p>6.3 Custodians shall involve the Treasury Board Secretariat in the final identification of surplus strategic properties 
in Canada that qualify for sale to the Canada Lands Company CLC Limited (CLC). They shall establish and communicate 
a process for the effective management of horizontal issues related to their disposal.</p><p>6.4 Prior to seeking an indication of interest in the surplus property, custodians shall ensure they can provide 
interested parties with sufficient information, in the following minimum areas, to allow them to make an informed decision 
within the timeframes allowed:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>legal risk analysis on title, including whether a duty to consult with Aboriginal groups exists;</li><li>the property's environmental and physical condition;</li><li>archaeological and heritage findings;</li><li>risk to wildlife habitat; and</li><li>market value of the property.</li></ol><p>6.5 Custodians shall formally determine the degree of interest in surplus properties in Canada by simultaneously 
providing federal departments, agent Crown corporations, provincial and municipal governments an opportunity to:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>acquire surplus routine properties for a public purpose, in the priority order noted above, before the property 
	is offered for sale on the open market; or</li><li>identify their public purpose interest in surplus strategic properties for equal consideration by the custodian 
	during the development of the disposal strategy.</li></ol><p>6.6 Custodians shall provide priority organizations or interested parties 30 days to identify their interest and 
an additional 90 days to confirm in writing the nature and scope of their interest, supported by a financial commitment. 
Custodians shall give an additional 120 days to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada to provide written confirmation 
if the real property is to be acquired to settle a comprehensive land claim.</p><p>6.7 In the case of a sale or transfer for public purpose:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Custodians shall ensure their deputy head is satisfied that the acquiring party has demonstrated that the surplus 
	property is required for public purpose consistent with its long-term plans and that the sale or transfer is the 
	best real property decision from a whole-of-government perspective, taking into account the market value of the 
	surplus property based on highest and best use.</li><li>Consideration received for property shall be based on market value for continued public purpose use, in accordance with the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12045">Appraisal and Estimates 
	Standard for Real Property</a></em>. The variance between the values should inform the conditions of sale, when 
    appropriate.</li><li>If surplus property sold or transferred for public purpose can or could potentially be rezoned and resold for 
	profit, custodians shall include appropriate covenants in the conveyance documents to ensure that the original 
	intent of the sale or transfer is respected.</li></ol><p>6.8 Custodians shall develop a balanced disposal strategy for strategic surplus properties that is supported by 
a comprehensive assessment of federal and other stakeholder interests (including those of official language minority communities), the legal risk analysis, and policy and financial 
considerations. They shall also develop a business case that is further supported by the valuation, determined in accordance 
with the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12045">Appraisal and Estimates 
Standard for Real Property</a></em>, and by a business plan from Canada Lands Company CLC Limited. </p><p>6.9 When the real property is contaminated and the acquiring party is undertaking the required remediation, custodians 
shall take steps to ensure that it is carried out within a reasonable length of time.</p><p>6.10 To share in the net proceeds from the sale or transfer of surplus real property custodians must:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>have an approved <em><strong>investment plan</strong></em>;</li><li>reinvest the proceeds in real property, consistent with their approved investment plan; and</li><li>satisfy the reporting requirements of the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12047">Reporting Standard on 
	Real Property</a></em>.</li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong>: Access to net proceeds is done through the
<a href="/pubs_pol/opepubs/TB_H/EXMA-eng.asp">expenditure management</a> process.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Responsibilities of other organizations"><p>7.1 Canada Lands Company CLC Limited (CLC) is a federal, non-agent Crown corporation mandated with the commercially
