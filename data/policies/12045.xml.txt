Purpose"><p>The Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy on the Management of Real Property</a></em> requires deputy heads to ensure their respective department maximizes the long-term economic advantage to the Crown, assesses opportunities to earn revenues, ensures real property decisions are financially prudent and represent the best value to the Canadian taxpayer and that the total consideration received or 
given by the government 
is justified in relation to the market value of the property.</p><p>To meet these requirements, departments must be able to determine the market value of the interests, benefits or rights involved. This standard establishes minimum requirements for making that determination before acquiring, disposing or entering into other arrangements with respect to real property.</p><p>This standard is issued pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act</a></em>, subsections 7(1), 9(1.1), 9(2) and the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-8.4/index.html">Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act</a></em>, subsection 16(4).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
