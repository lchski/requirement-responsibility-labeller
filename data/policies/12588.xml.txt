The deferred salary or wages are exempt from taxation until the funds are released to the employee.</p><p>This program has inherent benefits for employees and managers. It enables employees, while still receiving an income, to withdraw temporarily from active service to engage in developmental activities or to pursue other interests during the leave. Certain income tax benefits may also apply because of salary or wage deferral. The program permits managers greater flexibility to
            develop staff, accommodate temporary resources and, in certain circumstances, it may minimize or eliminate the need to lay off employees.</p><h3>Definition</h3><p>For this policy, SFL means authorized leave without pay of between 6 and 12 consecutive months. The employee must request this leave in advance and at that time arrange to have money deposited in a trust account that will provide income during the leave.</p><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>All indeterminate staff are eligible to apply for SFL. In addition, new employees from other departments who were eligible to take advantage of the program and have an approved SFL agreement may, subject to operational requirements, be permitted to continue with that plan in accordance with the (dept.) SFL program.</p><h3>Policy</h3><p>Subject to operational requirements and this policy, the appropriate delegated manager may grant employees SFL for between 6 and 12 consecutive months.</p><p>When operational circumstances permit, such leave may be approved on more than one occasion. It is mutually exclusive of other types of leave such as that for family-related needs or education.</p><p>While on leave, the employee must not work for a federal institution or be paid a salary from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and must adhere to the Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Code for the Public Service. With those exceptions, the department should not normally restrict the employee's activities during the leave.</p><p>In accordance with the 
            <em>Income Tax Regulations</em>, the employee must make a commitment to return to his or her regular employment with the department or another federal department for not less than the period of leave granted. Thus, SFL cannot be used for pre-retirement.</p><p>All provisions of Acts, Regulations, and collective agreements relating to "leave without pay for other reasons" of between 6 and 12 consecutive months also apply to SFL.</p><h3>Delegation of authority</h3><p>The deputy minister has delegated the authority to approve SFL to managers at the following levels:</p><p>(State here the classification and/or title of delegated managers)</p></appendix><appendix title="Procedures and Guidelines" anchor="9"><h3>Application and approval</h3><p>Before formally applying for SFL, employees should consult their SFL program co-ordinator or a pay and benefits specialist. Detailed information on employee benefits is available from the appropriate pay and benefits unit.</p><p>Completed 
            <a href="/tbsf-fsct/publi/330-109-eng.asp">"Application for Self-Funded Leave" forms (TBS 330-109)</a>, including salary deduction arrangements, must be received by the delegated manager and forwarded to the appropriate pay and benefits office for processing at least months before the actual leave begins. In most circumstances, advance notice of months will be
            needed to begin wage deferral. A copy of the form is to be sent to the financial institution that will administer the trust account. The delegated manager concerned will review all applications in a timely manner and approve participation, subject to operational requirements.</p><p>The maximum salary deferral period is years.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Revenue Canada stipulates that the actual period of leave must begin after a period not exceeding six years from the date on which the deferral began. A period of five years is recommended to allow for unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>The amount of salary or wages deferred in any year may be any amount of up to and including 33 1/3 per cent of the employee's substantive job-related income for that year. Income that may be used for deferral purposes includes regular salary or wages, the bilingualism bonus, and supervisory differential. The actual amount deferred will remain the same unless the employee requests a
            change.</p><p>The employee may request in writing a change to the amount of salary deferred. The pay and benefits unit would have to receive such requests at least months before the date on which the change is requested and not later than six months before the date the leave is due to begin.</p><h3>Pay administration and financial aspects</h3><p>When the pay and benefits unit receives an approved application form, it will verify that the deferral amount does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then sends the document to the SFL coordinator for regular transmission to an approved financial institution (see appendix D). Once an account number has been issued the pay and benefits unit initiates a salary deduction pay action.
            Supply and Services Canada will deduct funds and transfer them to the trust account established for the employee at the financial institution.</p><p>The trust account will generate interest that the financial institution must pay annually to the employee. The employee is then responsible for reporting this interest in his or her annual income tax return.</p><p>Withdrawing money other than interest from the trust account before it matures may be allowed only in cases of serious financial or other hardship and with the written authorization of the employee concerned and the departmental SFL program co-ordinator.</p><p>When the employee's trust agreement matures, the financial institution is to release the money to an account to which the employee has access, without further departmental involvement.</p><p>All amounts held for the employee's benefit in the trust account must be paid to the employee no later than the end of the first taxation year that begins after the end of the deferral period.</p><h3>Income tax and other deductions</h3><p>During the deferral period, all regular deductions will continue except for income tax and the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans on that part of salary or wages deferred.</p><p>During the actual leave period, deductions and benefits apply as described in appendix C.</p><p>When the funds are released to the employee, a deduction will be made at source for income tax and other statutory purposes.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p>Where an employee can demonstrate to the delegated manager that continuing with the plan would cause severe financial or other hardship, or where an employee participating in the plan has been identified as surplus or is laid off as a result of work force adjustment, a request will be made to the financial institution to release the accumulated funds to the employee as soon as
            possible. The employee can determine the financial and tax-related implications of withdrawal by discussing them with the appropriate district office of Revenue Canada-Taxation.</p><p>Should an employee die before the leave begins or while on leave, the funds shall be released to the employee's designated beneficiary or estate as determined by the executors or administrators of the estate.</p><h3>Postponement</h3><p>Withdrawal from the program may entail a considerable tax burden for the employee. The employee may therefore request that the planned period of leave be advanced or postponed for up to six months if this will prevent him or her from withdrawing from the program. The delegated manager will, based on operational requirements, make every reasonable effort to accommodate the
            employee's request. Such requests to delay the period of planned leave cannot, however, be accommodated where they would result in a salary or wage deferral beyond the maximum six-year limit specified in the 
            <em>Income Tax Regulations</em>.</p><p>If unforeseen and justifiable operational circumstances beyond the manager's control arise and no other feasible option exists, an appropriate authority may, at the manager's request, postpone the forthcoming leave, except where the employee's salary or wage deferral would exceed the maximum six-year limit.</p><h3>Changes to duration of leave</h3><p>An employee may, no later than six months before the planned leave date, request in writing a change to the duration of the leave if the leave period requested remains between 6 and 12 months. The delegated manager must approve such requests. The financial institution must also be advised of the change.</p><h3>Recall or denial</h3><p>Because of the financial implications for the employee, denying leave after the maximum six-year deferral period or recalling an employee from leave requires a manager to obtain the prior written authorization of the deputy minister.</p><h3>Transfer or promotion</h3><p>Since an appointment to a non-participating federal department or agency would require withdrawal from the SFL program, participating employees will be responsible for the financial implications of such appointments.</p><h3>Return to work after the period of leave</h3><p>The actual date of return to work or completion of the mandatory period after returning to work may be delayed for a valid reason such as sickness or maternity.</p><p>Where an employee does not fulfil the return to work requirements of this policy, the department must notify Revenue Canada-Taxation.</p></appendix><appendix title="Effects of Self-Funded Leave Without Pay On Employee Benefits and Contributions" anchor="10"><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Employees should consult a pay and benefit specialist for more information about the options available and for instructions to ensure continuing coverage.</p><table class="rpp widthFull" summary="Effects of Self-Funded Leave Without Pay On Employee Benefits and Contributions"><thead><tr class="alignTop"><th scope="col"><strong>Item</strong></th><th scope="col"><strong>Cost</strong></th><th scope="col"><strong>Comment</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="alignTop"><td>Income tax</td><td>Tax is reduced during the salary deferral period in proportion to the amount of salary deferred.</td><td><p>Income tax withheld will be adjusted during the deferral period.</p><p>When annual interest payments are made and when the trust matures, the financial institution will deduct and remit the required statutory deductions for income tax.</p><p>Note: Should the employee fail to take leave as required under the plan, all amounts held in trust must be reported as income in the first taxation year that begins after the end of deferral period.
