Application"><p>2.1 This  directive applies to the core public administration as defined in  section 11 of the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration  Act</em></a>, unless excluded through  specific acts, regulations or orders-in-council.</p><p>2.2 This  directive does not apply to positions within the Executive (EX) group. </p><p>2.3 This  directive does not apply to members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p><p>2.4 The  provisions in sections 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.2.1, 7.2.3, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 relating to  the role of the Treasury Board Secretariat in monitoring compliance and  directing measures to be taken in response to non-compliance do not apply with  respect to the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada and the Office  of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the Office of the Chief Electoral  Officer, the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying, the Office of the  Commissioner of Official Languages and the Office of the Public Sector  Integrity Commissioner. The deputy heads of these organizations are solely  responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with this policy within  their organizations, as well as for responding to cases of non-compliance in  accordance with any Treasury Board instruments providing principles and  guidance on the management of compliance.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 This directive is issued pursuant  to sections 7 and 11.1 of the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>.</p><p>3.2 This  directive formalizes the requirements for compliance with the <em>Policy on Classification</em> and related  instruments and provides deputy heads with direction and tools for assessing  the health of their classification programs through oversight. </p><p>3.3 A classification decision has financial  implications. It establishes the occupational group, sub-group (if applicable)  and level of the job and therefore the compensation. Deputy heads and their  sub-delegates are expected to make classification decisions with the same care,  attention and knowledge given to other financial transactions because, ultimately,  it is in the public interest to ensure that government funds are expended  wisely.</p><p>3.4 The Office of  the Chief Human Resources Officer is responsible for the oversight of the  Classification Program. The Office of the  Chief Human Resources Officer provides quality assurance of the Classification Program  across the CPA and ensures that its integrity is safeguarded. It  supports the sound management of the wage bill through appropriate  classification decisions and classification relativity across the CPA. It ensures that public funds are managed in  accordance with principles of affordability and value for money outlined in the <em>Policy Framework for the Management of  Compensation</em> and <em>Policy Framework for  Financial Management.</em></p><p>3.5 The Classification Oversight Model is  the tool that defines the strategic and desired outcomes for the Classification  Program. The three main components of  the oversight model, monitoring, audit and reporting, categorize the various  indicators of classification oversight and are found in the Classification  Oversight Model for Organizations (Appendix A) and the Classification Oversight  Model for the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (Appendix B).</p><p>3.6 Additional mandatory requirements are set  out in the following documents: </p><ul><li><em>Directive on Classification; </em></li><li><em>Directive on Classification Grievances;</em></li><li><em>Guide to Allocating  Positions Using the 1999 Occupational Group Definitions;</em></li><li><em>Job Evaluations  Standards (Classification Standards); </em></li><li><em>Occupational Group  Definitions;</em></li><li><em>Policy on  Classification; and </em></li><li><em>Table of Concordance. </em></li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
