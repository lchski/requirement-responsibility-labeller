dated October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2012 and both instruments replace the 2001 Policy on the Prevention and Resolution of 
Harassment in the Workplace.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2 Application"><p><strong>2.1</strong> This directive applies to the core public administration which includes organizations named in Schedule 
I and the other portions of the federal public administration named in Schedule IV of the 
<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act</a> unless excluded 
by specific acts, regulations or orders in council.</p><p><strong>2.2</strong> The provisions in sections 6.2.2, 6.2.3 and 7 relating to the role of the Treasury Board of Canada 
Secretariat in monitoring compliance and directing measures to be taken in response to non-compliance do not apply with 
respect to the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the 
Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying, the Office of the Commissioner of Official 
Languages and the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The deputy heads of these organizations are solely 
responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with this directive within their organizations, as well as for responding 
to cases of non-compliance in accordance with any Treasury Board instruments providing principles and guidance on the management 
of compliance.</p><p><strong>2.3</strong> The harassment complaint process established under this directive is available to employees of organizations 
described in 2.1. For individuals who are not employees as defined in <a href="#appA">Appendix A</a>, managers must address any allegation of 
harassment from these individuals in accordance with the spirit of this directive.</p><p><strong>2.4</strong> In circumstances where an employee files a harassment complaint against an individual who is not 
an employee as defined in <a href="#appA">Appendix A</a>, managers must apply the complaint process as established in this directive to the 
extent possible. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3 Context"><p><strong>3.1</strong> The prevention and resolution of harassment in the workplace is an essential component in the effective 
people management of an organization. The goal of Treasury Board as the employer is to maintain a productive, healthy and 
respectful workplace where positive working relationships and practices are promoted and where everyone is guided by the 
values of the public sector which includes treating each other with respect and fairness.</p><p>In keeping with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26041">Policy on Harassment Prevention and Resolution</a>, the Treasury Board is committed to having 
a harassment-free workplace. In part, this can be achieved by ensuring that every organization remains sensitive to the 
potential for harassment, or perceptions of harassment in the workplace, and actively managing any such situations whenever 
and wherever they arise. Requiring organizations across the core public administration to implement measures for preventing 
and managing workplace harassment will help the employer reduce the effects of stressful work situations on employees, and 
improve their overall wellbeing and productivity, which in turn will lead to better results for Canadians.</p><p><strong>3.2</strong> Harassment is serious and needs to be addressed promptly, with sensitivity, competence and discretion. 
The primary goal is to resolve allegations of harassment in the most informal way feasible, with the least disruption possible 
for the parties involved and the work environment. While the seriousness of harassment allegations calls for access to a 
careful and rigorous process from the outset, it is consistent with such a process that many cases may, upon closer exploration 
and with the consent of all parties, be effectively dealt with through informal resolution processes.</p><p><strong>3.3</strong> This directive flows from the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26041">Policy on Harassment Prevention and Resolution</a> and requires 
the establishment and the maintenance of an effective harassment complaint process. It sets out specific roles and responsibilities 
of the designated official(s) pertaining to the application of this directive.</p><p><strong>3.4</strong> Deputy heads have the responsibility and are accountable for the establishment and maintenance of 
a respectful and harassment-free workplace, and for the prompt resolution of related complaints. Treasury Board provides 
broad direction to deputy heads while the latter are responsible for implementation.</p><p><strong>3.5</strong> This directive is issued pursuant to section 7 and subsection 11.1 of the 
<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act</a>.</p><p><strong>3.6</strong> This directive is to be read in conjunction with the following:</p><ul><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26041">Policy on Harassment Prevention and Resolution</a></li><li><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-2/index.html">Canada Labour Code</a>, including the
