For the purpose of this section, the term “payable” is used to represent transactions that are to be charged against the appropriation at year-end. As a result, this section focuses on whether transactions are payables that are to be charged against appropriations at fiscal year-end. It does not cover whether transactions should be recorded in accordance with the Government’s stated accounting policies, which are based on Public Sector Accounting Standards. Liabilities, including allowances, should be recorded in the financial statements in accordance with Public Sector Accounting Standards and the Government of Canada Accounting Handbook.</li><li>Appropriations represent spending authority that is approved by Parliament. In order to accurately measure the use of this authority and to demonstrate accountability for departmental spending, the appropriate recording and reporting of all payables as at year-end is essential.</li><li>Payables resulting in a charge against an appropriation are certified in accordance with section 33 of the FAA, following certification pursuant to section 34 of the FAA by individuals who are responsible for the performance of account verification and who have delegated financial signing authority.</li><li>Payables can be determined and recorded on an individual basis, or by group or class of recipients when practical and economical to do so.</li><li>When the exact value of the payable cannot be determined, an estimate is used to record the amount of the payable, provided that a reasonably accurate value can be assigned. An audit trail allowing verification of the reasonableness of the estimate is to be kept.</li><li>Payables are to be charged to the appropriation if the following conditions are met at March 31:
			
					<ul><li>in the case of debt incurred for work, the work has been satisfactorily performed whether or not the amount of the debt is due;</li><li>in the case of debt incurred for goods, the goods have been satisfactorily received and ownership is obtained whether or not the amount of the debt is due;</li><li>in the case of debt incurred for services, the services have been satisfactorily rendered whether or not the amount of the debt is due;</li><li>in the case of an amount payable between federal organizations, it is subject to conditions listed above as if it is a debt;</li><li>in the case of a debt resulting from a transfer payment, the amount is due; that is, the Government’s obligation to make a transfer payment and/or the entitlement of the recipient to receive a transfer payment has been established;</li><li>in all other cases, the amount of the debt is due and owed according to a contractual agreement or other legally binding agreement or memorandum of understanding; and,</li><li>in all cases, the amount of the debt should be substantiated (i.e. is auditable) and valued.</li></ul></li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="D" title="Work-in-process"><ol start="8"><li>The value of work performed and services rendered is determined on the basis of performance up to year-end and on billings or estimates of the debt owing for the related performance.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="E" title="Acquisition of real property not already in the name of the Crown"><ol start="9"><li>A payable is recorded and charged to the appropriation when:

The circumstances and related terms and conditions for each type of entitlement (e.g. severance pay, education allowance, transitional support measure) must be assessed individually in order to determine when the amount becomes due and owing to the employee.</clause><clause anchor="10.3">Unpaid amounts for employees seconded or transferred are recorded as payables and charged to the appropriation.</clause><clause anchor="10.4">Retroactive wage and salary settlements owed are recorded as payables and charged to the appropriation when salary agreements have been ratified and signed on or before March 31.</clause></clauses></chapter><chapter anchor="G" title="Advance payments"><ol start="11"><li>Payables for advance payments that are due on or before year-end are recorded and charged to the appropriation if they meet the requirements described in the Directive on Payments.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="H" title="Holdbacks"><ol start="12"><li>Payables for which there is a holdback of payment for work performed, service rendered or goods received are recorded and charged to the appropriation for both the net amount due and the holdback at year-end.
