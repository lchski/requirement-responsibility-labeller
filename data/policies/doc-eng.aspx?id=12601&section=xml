Introduction"><p>It is recognized that good labour-management relations are essential to good human resources management. Consultation, 
through communication and sustained dialogue between management and bargaining agents, can contribute to the enhancement 
of the relationships between the parties. Accordingly it is essential that the senior officials of both management and bargaining 
agents be committed to continuously enhancing and improving the process. Consultation is essential in building relationships; 
it is an on-going process not limited to formal meetings between the parties.</p><p>Implementing effective labour-management committees necessitates a culture change for the parties involved. Nonetheless, 
the development of relationships based on trust and mutual respect and the sharing of information and views proves advantageous 
to both parties. Common understanding of the role and the intent of consultation as defined in these guidelines is essential 
at all the levels of the process to achieve its goal.</p><p>The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework for the establishment and operation of LMCC's that assists 
the parties to function in an efficient and effective manner in order to improve their working environment.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2.

agents, establish a consultation committee for the purpose of exchanging information and obtaining views and advice on workplace 
issues.</p><p>The legislation also refers to issues that may be subject of consultation including among others, harassment in the workplace<span class="underLine">,</span> the disclosure of information concerning wrongdoing in the public service and the protection

PSLRA</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. What is consultation"><p>Consultation is a process for seeking and providing information and advice, exchanging views, and discussing issues, 
at a level (e.g., national, regional, local, sectoral or specific occupational group) appropriate to addressing or resolving 
issues, in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. To be effective, the process must be based on an honest and open commitment, 
by both parties, to the sharing of information and to listening to each other's opinions, observations, and recommendations, 
prior to decisions being taken. This allows each party to understand the full implications of decisions and actions on their 
legitimate interests. However, some limitations must be respected. They include:</p><ul><li>The rights of management and the bargaining agent must not be compromised, encroached upon, or diminished;</li><li>The provisions of collective agreements and statutes, and their intent, must be adhered to;</li><li>Matters for which other formal channels have been established (e.g., Occupational Health or Safety, National Joint 
  Council matters) must normally be addressed in those fora; and</li><li>Issues relating to an individual such as grievance cases must not be discussed in a way that would breach confidentiality. 
  Note: Grievance cases may be discussed in a generic way if such discussions provide a means to identify trends or underlying 
  causes that would help in resolving the problem.</li></ul><p>As a general rule, matters should be discussed at a level (e.g., national, regional, local, sectoral or specific occupational 
group) appropriate to the resolution of the issue or the problem. In some cases it is helpful to discuss matters that are 
being addressed in depth at a different level. For example:</p><ul><li>To provide information on the matter;</li><li>To explain or define the application of a policy related to the matter;</li><li>To discuss problems related to the matter with a view to reducing tension and promoting understanding between the 
  parties concerned;</li><li>To communicate information when appropriate to other levels of management.</li></ul><p>LMCC representatives' throughout the organization should ensure they have a common understanding of this approach prior 
to addressing issues. This can include discussing the process or joint training.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Composition and structure of committees"><p>The structure of the committee is to be established in consultation with bargaining agents. The primary LMCC normally 
is to be established at the national level between management and all representing bargaining agents. The parties may agree 
to establish separate LMCCs for certain bargaining agents. Sub-LMCCs may be established where a subject requires in-depth 
study or with just those bargaining agents, where a specific issue only pertains to their members. When establishing an 
LMCC, the parties should strive to achieve equitable participation (i.e., balanced representation). This includes, for instance, 
the nomination of chairs from both parties.</p><p>The representatives should include individuals with the appropriate managerial authority to make decisions and to speak 
to the issues of concern. A more elaborate LMCC structure may be required for an organisation that could include a number 
of different committee levels that reflect the operational environment of the organizations involved, (e.g., national, regional, 
local, sectoral or specific occupational group). The parties, at the national level, should examine organizational needs 
and determine what committee structure and/or sub-structure is appropriate.</p><p>By mutual agreement, the committee may invite additional persons to attend meetings for the purpose 
of providing advice or information pertaining to a particular subject on the agenda or establish sub-committees where a 
subject requires in-depth study. Consultation should take place with the relevant managers and Human Resources officials 
on issues where their expertise is needed.</p><p>Management provides administrative support (i.e., a committee secretary) to the committee.</p><p>The use of substitutes or alternates at a given LMCC meeting should be kept to the minimum. Stability in participation 
is part of the commitment made when joining an LMCC and will serve to ensure continuity of relationships and issue management.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Protocols"><section anchor="7.1" title="7.1 Terms of Reference"><p>LMCC Terms of Reference should be jointly developed and can include a provision that allows the parties to introduce 
amendments from time to time. They should include details about the following protocols as well as committee composition 
and structure. A sample is found in Annex A to these guidelines.</p></section><section anchor="7.2" title="7.2 Meeting schedules"><p>Consideration should be given to conducting at least two meetings each year at the national level, be they formal or 
informal, although the committee may wish to meet more often when either party raises matters of significant consequence. 
Depending on a given department/agency or bargaining agent structure or size and the level (e.g., national, regional, local, 
sectoral or specific occupational group) of LMCC, meetings could take place more frequently. The formality of meetings may 
vary depending on the level of the LMCC or size of the workplace, but this should be mutually agreed upon.</p></section><section anchor="7.3" title="7.3 Meeting location, time and costs"><p>Committee meetings should be held on the employer's premises and at times determined by mutual agreement of the parties. 
Meetings should be scheduled during working hours. Some participants may not have the resources or information required 
to participate and financial assistance or other support may be needed for their representation to be assured. This could 
include leave with pay for preparation or follow-up from the meeting and travel costs associated with meeting. In all cases, 
collective agreement provisions and/or applicable terms and conditions of employment regarding travel-time and leave for 
union business must be adhered to. Representatives on the committee or other employees who are invited guests shall be protected 
against any loss of regular pay due to attendance at meetings.</p><p>LMCC members should be permitted to remotely attend through teleconference.</p><p>Meetings must be conducted in accordance with the Treasury Board Official Languages policy.</p></section><section anchor="7.4" title="7.4 Agendas"><p>The co-chairs discuss and prepare the agenda, in conjunction with input from the other committee members and as required 
from local, regional, sectoral, or specific occupational group sub-committees, in advance of each meeting. Additional items 
may be added at the meeting with agreement of the parties and urgent issues may be added to the agenda at any time.</p><p>The Committee members who submit agenda items to the committee secretary should also provide explanatory notes and/or 
pertinent documentation. The scope of the items for discussion should reflect the level of consultation (e.g., national 
vs. regional vs. local). The agenda and any related documents should be produced in both official languages in accordance 
with Treasury Board Official Languages policy.</p><p>Meeting agendas, including time and place, should be issued with as much advanced notice as possible. If there is documentation 
or literature that should be read prior to the meeting, sufficient time should be allocated in the notice period to ensure 
LMCC members have the appropriate opportunity to do so.</p></section><section anchor="7.5" title="7.5 Minutes of meetings"><p>The LMCC Secretary ensures that minutes are produced and distributed as soon as possible after each meeting. Issues discussed, 
decisions or follow-up actions and consensus or disagreement by the parties should be reflected in the minutes, which are 
approved by the co-chairs. Committee members are responsible for discussing any matters of interest or action items resulting 
from the meetings with their respective colleagues, so that any action flowing from the meeting can be taken expeditiously. 
Deadlines or target dates should be fixed for any actions items to ensure follow-up and progress reports are provided to 
the LMCC members.</p><p>Any written material to be released or publicized as a result of consultation must be with the consent of the committee 
members. They must be made available in both official languages.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="8. Assessment of meaningful consultation and of its results"><p>It is highly recommended that the parties periodically undertake an assessment of how well an LMCC or any of its sub-committees 
is functioning. The following are some of the success indicators that could be used in measuring performance:</p><ul><li>Consultation committees are in place and are operating in a meaningful manner (e.g., they are well-attended and productive);</li><li>Consultation and dialogue are ongoing and not restricted to formalized meetings;</li><li>Consultation is constructive. Participants feel they can raise issues and have them addressed positively. Participants 
  feel their involvement is valued;</li><li>Discussions are genuine and both parties have a sense of accomplishment;</li><li>There is an improvement in labour-management relations, (i.e., there is a building of mutual respect and trust between 
  the parties, working on attitudes and skills that foster meaningful consultation); and</li><li>There is an improvement to the overall work environment, discernable in the periodic survey of public servants.</li></ul><p>A tool to assist the various LMCC's in measuring their performance has been developed and is found 
in Annex B to these guidelines.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="9" title="9. Best practices"><div class="highlightBox"><p>Certain departments already have in place, LMCCs that seem to be functioning well. Current examples include National 
    Defence, Industry Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Passports, and Natural Resources Canada. Their consultation process 
    deals with the consultation structure, the preparation and operation of meetings, the composition and the members of 
    the committee, as well as process evaluation initiatives. Details regarding their efforts can be obtained from their 
    corporate Human Resources officials.</p></div></chapter><chapter anchor="10" title="10. References"><ul><li><em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=852#252">
