Effective Date"><p>1.1This framework takes effect on July 1, 2007.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Context"><p>2.1 Information is the cornerstone of a democratic, effective, and accountable government. Therefore, information must be well managed throughout its life cycle, allowing for an effective and responsive government.</p><p>2.2 Stewardship of information and technology encompasses fiscal responsibility in meeting client needs and expectations both internal and external to government. This includes ensuring that technical solutions and information management practices are respectful of individual privacy and that information is secure from unauthorized access. Both information and technology must be developed, deployed, and managed in appropriate formats. This facilitates usability by all those accessing government 
services, including persons with disabilities. Additionally, it ensures the support of the provision of services and information in both official languages, while respecting individual and collective rights.</p><p>2.3 The Policy Framework for Information and Technology provides the strategic context for the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742"><em>Policy on Information Management</em></a> and the <em><a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755">Policy on the Management of Information Technology</a></em>. It also takes into consideration the <em><a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/gospubs/TBM_128/siglist-eng.asp">Privacy 
and Data Protection policy</a></em>, the <em><a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/gospubs/TBM_121/siglist-eng.asp">Access to Information policy</a></em>, and the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578">Policy on Government Security</a></em>. In addition, it provides guiding principles to sound information and technology management practices across government. These principles also serve to support individuals and employees in exercising their rights 
and performing their duties.</p><p>2.4 This framework is part of an integrated and consistent approach to public service management. As such, it shows its alignment and relationships with key policy frameworks and legislation.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Principles"><p>3.1 The management of information and associated technologies is guided by a commitment to the following principles:</p><h3>Information</h3><p>Information under the control of federal departments both records government actions and also preserves Canadian history. Information supports public reporting, sound planning, and decision making for current and future governments. Because information is a valuable asset, it must be treated as such and that is a responsibility of all employees.</p><h3>Information technology</h3><p>Efficient, effective, and innovative information technology (IT) is a key enabler to achieving well-managed information in support of policies, programs, and services.</p><h3>Stewardship</h3><p>Information must be rigorously managed throughout its life cycle, regardless of medium or format, for as long as it is required by departments to meet their operational and fiscal responsibilities, legal obligations, and accountabilities. This means ensuring that strategies are in place to ensure that information is current, complete, and accurate. IT is a key enabler and must also be well managed within a strict business case and project management discipline. Sound stewardship means that business 
needs determine information needs and associated processes, application, and IT.</p><h3>Whole-of-government approach</h3><p>A whole-of-government approach means working across departmental and jurisdictional boundaries to provide, within legislated parameters, timely access to seamless and integrated information. It means setting government-wide framework and policy, standards, guidelines, practices, and tools to ensure the quality of information and integration. Efficient integration is achieved when business, information, and technology are reliable and interoperable. It means standardizing information sources of 
common data, reusing information and technology solutions to eliminate duplication and redundancy, maximizing investments, and minimizing costs, while respecting the privacy rights of those individuals accessing government services. Above all, a whole-of-government approach means that, while individuals interact with many different organizations, their experience is with the Government of Canada.</p><h3>Access and privacy</h3><p>Respect for individual privacy applies across the information life cycle in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Respecting privacy means limiting government interventions into the private lives of Canadians to lawful and necessary purposes and ensuring adequate protection of personal information in accordance with applicable legislation. IT is not only a key enabler to achieve well-managed information, it is also an essential component in ensuring the protection of privacy.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is essential to government decision making and the delivery of services. Effective security of information requires a systematic approach that identifies and categorizes information and associated assets, assesses risks to them, and implements appropriate personnel, physical, and IT safeguards.</p><h3>Transparency</h3><p>Employees document actions and decisions in support of government programs and activities, and maintain information so that it is accessible to anyone who is authorized to have access, including those individuals exercising their rights to access information under the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Managing information to support transparency and accountability also means reporting on performance in ways that are clear to Canadians and Parliament. </p><h3>Official languages</h3><p>The delivery of information and technology services to the public and to employees in both official languages reflects values of equality and respect. The delivery of quality services to the public and employees is guided by the principle of <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12515">institutional bilingualism</a> that is also expressed in a work environment conducive to the use of both official languages in bilingual regions in accordance with the <em>
Official Languages Act</em> and associated policy instruments.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
