An example is litigation initiated by the Government in which recovery of funds or punitive damages are reasonably expected to be received. (PS 3320.08)</li><li>Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements in accordance with PS 3320.12-.20. Further to PS 3320.12, the uncertainty relating to the occurrence or non-occurrence of future event(s) can be expressed by a range of probabilities. As a guideline, the range of probabilities can be broadly defined as:
			
					<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>Likely: a greater than 70% probability;</li><li>Unlikely: a less than 30% probability; and</li><li>Not determinable: a probability between 30% and 70%.</li></ol></li><li>To illustrate the application of the accounting treatment related to contingent assets in specific situations please refer to the table below:

Care should also be exercised in the disclosure of contingent assets to avoid misleading implications as to the likelihood of realization. Departments may wish to consult with the Government Accounting Policy and Reporting Division of Treasury Board Secretariat for proposed note disclosure.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="D" title="Departmental Financial Statements"><ol start="6"><li>Applies without additional policy choices or interpretation for Departmental Financial Statements.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="E" title="Other related references"><ul class="list-unstyled"><li>PS 3300 Contingent liabilities</li><li>PS 3310 Loan guarantees</li><li>GC 3300/3310 Contingent Liabilities &amp; Loan Guarantees</li></ul></chapter></chapters></doc>
