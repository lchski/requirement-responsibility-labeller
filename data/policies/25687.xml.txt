The senior departmental official designated responsible by the deputy head may be the department’s Chief Information Officer (CIO), Information Management Senior Official (IMSO), Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or Senior Human Resource Officer (SHRO). This standard supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755"><em>Policy on the Management of Information Technology</em></a>, the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742">Policy on Information Management</a>,</em> the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy on the Management of Projects</a></em>, the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18225">Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</a></em> and the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589">Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</a>,</em>  by outlining requirements for investing in, or when upgrading, <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems.  </p><p><strong>3.2 </strong>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is defined as a technology strategy that integrates a set of business functions such as finance, materiel, human resource (HR), purchasing and asset management, through tight linkages from operational business transactions through to financial records.  <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems enable the flow of information across the organization, in end-to-end business processes, through a comprehensive set of interconnected systems modules. <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems are packaged application software suites, which support the common business processes, functions and data for the systems of record in an enterprise. The system of record is defined as the authoritative source of data that any stakeholder in an enterprise can reference to support their activities and responsibilities. The systems which this standard applies to are outlined in Section 6.1 and prescribed by the different policy authorities described in Section 8, “Roles and responsibilities of government organizations.”</p><p><strong>3.3  </strong><abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems, configured in alignment with the Government of Canada (GC)’s common business processes for Finance, Materiel and HR, will enable a consistent government-wide approach to corporate administration by enabling the standardization of business processes, data and supporting information systems. This standardization facilitates both the integration of information systems and resources and their interoperability across the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s back-office administration. The implementation of standard <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems supporting common business processes will improve the quality, timeliness and reliability of information for decision making, both within departments and government-wide and will serve over time, to reduce inefficiencies, duplication and costs in back office administration.  </p><p><strong>3.4  </strong>This standard is issued under the authority of section 7 of the <abbr title="Financial Administration Act">FAA</abbr>.</p><p><strong>3.5  </strong>This standard is to be read in conjunction with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12452">Policy Framework for Information and Technology</a></em>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755"><em>Policy on Management of Information Technology</em></a>, the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742">Policy on Information Management</a></em>, the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18225">Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services</a></em>, the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy on the Management of Projects</a></em> and the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589">Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems</a></em>. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Definitions"><p><strong>4.1 </strong>Definitions to be used in the interpretation of this standard are included in the Appendix.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Standard statement"><h3>5.1 Objectives</h3><p>5.1.1 Ensure that investments made in <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems, either at the moment of initial acquisition by a department, or when departments are required to upgrade their existing systems, drive the adoption of standardized <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> product configurations in use with the common <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>-wide business processes for financial, materiel and <abbr title="Human Resource">HR</abbr> management.</p><p>5.1.2 Maximize the benefits of the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s investments in <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems by rationalizing the number and diversity of systems of record in use, thereby reducing the complexity and overall costs associated with implementation and ongoing operations, through increased standardization and economies of scale.</p><p>5.1.3 Facilitate the migration from individual department-specific <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> infrastructure and information systems to service cluster groups wherein departments’ individual systems of record cohabitate securely.  This supports multiple departments accessing the shared <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> infrastructure and information systems in use by each member of the cluster group.</p><h3>5.2 Expected results</h3><p>5.2.1 Increased efficiency and effectiveness of information technology used to support improved program and service delivery;</p><p>5.2.2 Increased use of government-wide standardized common business processes, data and systems as defined by the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO), the Office of the Comptroller General (OCG) and the Chief Information Officer Branch (CIOB);</p><p>5.2.3 Improved leveraging of Government of Canada investments in <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems which can reduce overall costs and achieve economies of scale;</p><p>5.2.4 Increased consolidation of common technology, information assets and services in support of <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems, resulting in fewer, more interoperable systems;</p><p>5.2.5 Increased standardization, consistency, quality and reliability of information within <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> systems to support improved decision making and stewardship.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6.
