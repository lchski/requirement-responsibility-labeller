Transfer payments are categorized as grants, contributions and other transfer payments. Transfer payments do not include investments, loans or loan guarantees.</p><p>5.2.2 As set out in the guidelines in <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> Technical Information Bulletin B-067, <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gm/b-067/b-067-e.html"><em>Good and Services Tax Treatment of Grants and Subsidies</em></a>, transfer payments made for a public purpose where there is no direct link between the payment and a supply (e.g. property or a service) made by the grantee (recipient) to either the grantor (federal departments) or a specified third party, are not payments for a supply and are therefore not subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>.</p><p>In this case, when a government department provides funding (e.g., through transfer payment agreements) to an outside party (the recipient) to undertake a project, the transfer payment agreement may provide that the funding can be used to reimburse all or a Part of the eligible project costs incurred by the recipient in carrying out the project. The <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> paid by the recipient on its input into the project may be considered to be Part of the eligible project costs under a transfer payment agreement except for those amounts that are eligible for an Input Tax Credit (ITC) or a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> rebate. The portion of <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> cost that is not eligible for reimbursement through an <abbr title="Input Tax Credit">ITC</abbr> or a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> rebate may be considered as Part of eligible project costs. However, this portion of <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> reimbursed to the recipient must be charged to the program's appropriation (e.g. Vote 10 appropriation) instead of the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr>.</p><p>5.2.3 It should be noted, however, that a transfer payment falling within Treasury Board's definition of a transfer payment may still be subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. This is the case where there is direct link between the transfer payment and a supply to the grantor (departments). The payment may be an amount payable for a supply for purposes of the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> (see B-067 <em>Goods and Services Tax Treatment of Grants and Subsidies (TIB)</em>), and may be subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. When in doubt as to whether <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> applies to a specific transfer payment, departments are to request a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> ruling from <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. While awaiting a <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> ruling, the department is to pay the amount of tax invoiced by the recipient. The <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr> is in place as a mechanism for the department to account for the tax. In addition, any reimbursement to the recipient, net of any <abbr title="Input Tax Credit">ITC</abbr> or <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> rebate, would also be subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. In such circumstances the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> paid or payable by the department on the net reimbursable amount may be charged to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr>.</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="5.3 Contracts "><p>5.3.1 When a government department enters into a contract to purchase taxable supplies, these payments may have tax implications. The terms of the contract are also to provide that the payment for the supplies excludes any <abbr title="Input Tax Credit">ITC</abbr> or <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> rebate that the contractor may be eligible for under the <abbr title="Excise Tax Act">ETA</abbr>.</p><p>5.3.2 When the supplier is a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> registrant, and incurs an expense on its own account (i.e., not as an agent of a federal department) in providing taxable supplies to a department, the supplier is generally eligible to claim an <abbr title="Input Tax Credit">ITC</abbr> for any <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> paid on the expense. In these cases the reimbursement amounts payable by a department pursuant to the contract (i.e., expense amount excluding <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> <abbr title="Input Tax Credit">ITC</abbr>) is treated as additional payment for the taxable supply to the department. Accordingly the reimbursement is subject to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> at the same rate as the taxable supplies. The <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> payable by a department on the reimbursement may be charged to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr>.</p><p>5.3.3 When the supplier is not a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> registrant, and incurs an expense on its own account in providing taxable supplies to a department, it is not eligible to claim an <abbr title="Input Tax Credit">ITC</abbr> under the <abbr title="Excise Tax Act">ETA</abbr>. In these cases, the reimbursable amounts (i.e., supplier's expense amounts including <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> paid by the supplier on the expenses less any <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> rebates) will be treated as additional payment for the taxable supply. However, as the supplier is not a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> registrant the payment will not be subject to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. In these cases, the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> included in the reimbursable amount represents a cost to the department and not the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> paid or payable by the department; therefore, it is charged to the appropriation and not the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr>.</p><p>5.3.4 When a supplier incurs an expense as an agent on behalf of a department in providing taxable supplies to the department, the supplier is not eligible to claim an <abbr title="Input Tax Credit">ITC</abbr> or a rebate under the <abbr title="Excise Tax Act">ETA</abbr> for the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> paid on the department's expense, even if the supplier is a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> registrant. In these cases, the department would reimburse the supplier for the total of the expense and the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> that the supplier incurred as an agent on behalf of the department. The <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> included in the reimbursement amount represents the department's <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> payable and may be charged to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr>.</p></section><section anchor="5.4" title="5.4 GST/HST on expenses reimbursed to employees"><p>5.4.1 A reimbursement is a payment made by an employer to repay an employee for expenses (e.g., courses, transportation and office supplies) he or she personally incurred for the purpose of government business. An amount constitutes a reimbursement where the amount is fully accounted for by the employee receiving the payment (i.e., the employee is required to provide receipts or documentation to the employer.) Note that reimbursements to employees do not include amounts paid on an account for which the department is solely liable (e.g., departmental acquisition cards, departmental travel expense accounts and departmental travel expense cards).</p><p>5.4.2 The <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr> may be charged for <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> incurred on expenses reimbursed to employees. Because <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> is not applicable outside Canada, when a claim includes expenses incurred both within and outside Canada, the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> to be charged to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr> is to be calculated on the Canadian portion only.</p><p>5.4.3 There are two methods to calculate the amount of <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> chargeable to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr> on reimbursable expenses. These factors recognize that the total expense may include gratuities, provincial sales tax and other amounts not subject to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>.</p><ul><li><strong>Method 1:</strong> 4/104ths, 12/112ths, 13/113ths and/or 14/114ths. This method consists of calculating 12/112ths (or 10.71%) of the total amount of reimbursable expenses incurred in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario; 13/113ths (or 11.50%) of the total amount of reimbursable expenses incurred in Prince Edward Island; 14/114ths (or 12.28%) of the total amount of reimbursable expenses incurred in Nova Scotia; and 4/104ths (or 3.85%) of the total amount of reimbursable expenses incurred in the remaining provinces; and charging the amount to the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr>.

 <ul><li>In lieu of claiming a municipal rebate for <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> on inputs for the provision of water, sewerage and drainage services, reporting entities calculate an <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> Municipal Rebate Adjustment Amount annually.

A <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> interpretation may apply to departmental programs as a whole but does not bind <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> or absolve departments from <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> liabilities if they incorrectly apply <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s interpretation or opinion to a specific transaction.</p></section><section anchor="6.5" title="6.5 Taxable employee benefits"><p>6.5.1 Some employee benefits are subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. The <abbr title="Excise Tax Act">ETA</abbr> and the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/">Income Tax Act</a></em> are the sources for determining which benefits and benefit amounts are subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> applies to the employee benefit when the location of employment is in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, or Prince Edward Island.</p><p>6.5.2 Generally, an employee benefit is subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> when the benefit results from the supply (other than an exempt or zero-rated supply) and the benefit is included in the calculation of an employee's income, according to paragraph 6(1)(a), (e), (k) or (l) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. Therefore, the whole amount received, including <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>, is included in the employee's income as a taxable benefit.</p><p>6.5.3 When a department pays a supplier for supplies used to provide a taxable benefit to an employee, any <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> included in the payment may be recorded as a debit in the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> <abbr title="Refundable Advance Account">RAA</abbr>. When the taxable benefit is included in the employee's income for the year, the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> that the department paid, or that is payable for the property or services used to provide the benefit, is to be added to the amount of the benefit. In effect, the employee "pays" the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> on the benefit and the department "collects" it. Technically, the department is considered to have collected <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> from the employee, and the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> is considered to have been paid by the employee on supplies received from the department as a private individual.</p><p>6.5.4 Ordinarily, under section 173 of the <abbr title="Excise Tax Act">ETA</abbr>, when a <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> registrant provides a taxable supply to an employee that results in a taxable benefit to the employee, the registrant is required to remit tax on that benefit, although no tax is actually collected from the employee. This rule does not apply to government departments, and departments do not remit the tax on taxable benefits. However, departments are to determine the appropriate amount of <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> to be included in calculating an employee's taxable income.</p><p>6.5.5 Supplies to Indians and Indian bands</p><ul><li>Generally, individual Indians and Indian bands may purchase property free of <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> when the property is provided on or delivered to a reserve.

 Property and services acquired by Indians and Indian bands off a reserve in Ontario without the property being delivered to a reserve and the services being performed on a reserve, will generally be subject to the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> as of July 1, 2010. However, since September 1, 2010, point-of-sale relief equal to the 8% provincial Part of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> is provided for qualifying off-reserve supplies of property or services to eligible Ontario First Nations purchasers. For more information on qualifying off-reserve supplies of property or services and who is eligible for the relief, refer to the Ontario Ministry of Finance's Harmonized Sales Tax Guide 80, <a href="http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/guides/hst/80.html"><em>Ontario First Nations Point-of-Sale Exemptions</em></a>.</li></ul><p>6.5.6 Supplies to provincial government entities</p><ul><li>The federal government enters into Reciprocal Taxation Agreements with most of the provinces and territories to set out negotiated arrangements for the reciprocal payment of taxes and fees levied by the respective governments.
