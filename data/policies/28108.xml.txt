Effective Date"><p>1.1
      This directive
      takes effect on October 9, 2014. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 
      This directive
      applies to departments as defined in Section 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>, unless excluded by
      specific acts, regulations, or orders-in-council.</p><p>2.2 
      All other
      federal institutions are encouraged to use this directive to define their own
      open government policies and practices. </p><p>2.3 
      This
      directive is to be applied to government information of business value required
      to support the delivery of programs and services by departments as of the
      effective date above in order to determine eligibility and facilitate planning

      with the directive within their organizations, as well as for responding to
      cases of non-compliance in accordance with any Treasury Board instruments that provide
      principles and guidance on the management of compliance.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 
      The Government
      of Canada's commitment to open government is founded on the strong history of
      transparency and accountability first established with the enactment of the
      Access to Information Act in 1983 followed by the Federal Accountability Act in
      2006 which introduced proactive disclosure. In 2012 the Government joined the
      Open Government Partnership and in June 2013 the Government endorsed the G8
      Charter on Open Data.</p><p>3.2 
      The
      expectations of Canadians for increased access to, and the proactive release of,
      federal data and information will require government departments and agencies to
      make their information resources that are eligible for release to be more easily
      discoverable and reusable. </p><p>3.3 
      Strong
      information management practices are the cornerstone of the Government of
      Canada's open government activities. These practices increase efficiency,
      reduce costs, improve services, safeguard personal, classified and confidential
      information, and ensure the availability of high-quality, authoritative
      information, ultimately enabling departments to be more responsive and accountable
      to Canadians.</p><p>3.4 
      This directive
      supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742"><em>Policy on Information Management</em></a> by promoting information management
      practices which enable the proactive and ongoing release of government
      information.  </p><p>3.5 
      This
      directive is to be read in conjunction with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16552"><em>Directive on Recordkeeping</em></a> and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12316"><em>Communications Policy of the
      Government of Canada</em></a><em>. </em>In
      addition, this directive will be reinforced by additional guidance, tools, and
      resources, including guidance on licences and release criteria.</p><p>3.6
