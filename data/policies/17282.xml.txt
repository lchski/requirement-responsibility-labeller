Purpose"><p>This Treasury Board Information Technology Standard (TBITS-25) adopts the Canadian component of the NATO codification 
system as the materiel classification code for use by the Government of Canada. The specified standards are listed in the 
"Allied Codification Publication No. 1 (A Cod P.1), NATO Manual on Codification" issued by the Materiel Management Systems 
Section, Defence Support Division, NATO Headquarters, Brussels.</p><p>In recognition of its own national needs, Canada tailored the NATO Codification System to Canadian requirements and named 
the ensuing system the Canadian Government Cataloguing System (CGCS). The
<abbr title="Canadian Government Cataloguing System">CGCS</abbr> adheres to the international agreements that govern 
the implementation and use of the NATO Codification System. In Canada the CGCS is administered and maintained by the Department 
of National Defence - Directorate of Cataloguing and Identification. A "Guide to the CGCS" is available from this organization. 
(See Section 8 - Where to obtain copies).</p><p>The Government of Canada is using current technology to manage its affairs more efficiently and economically. The NATO 
Materiel Coding Standard will help achieve that goal by standardizing the format used to identify all government materiel 
assets. This in turn will enable departments to communicate better and carry out their transactions electronically.</p><p>The objectives of this standard are:</p><ul><li>to provide a uniform system of identifying materiel assets within the federal government;</li><li>to enhance the capability to share and integrate asset management information electronically (government-wide);</li><li>to provide a basis for the development of electronic transactions;</li><li>to help avoid duplication of effort therefore minimizing the cost of materiel assets management; and</li><li>to contribute to the more efficient and economical management of materiel assets.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Application"><p>The NATO item identification code, the NSN (NATO stock number) will be the standard materiel assets code for departmental 
assets management systems in the Canadian federal government.</p><p>This standard must be used for the design and implementation of new materiel coding systems in the federal government. 
As a minimum, all new or redesigned departmental electronic materiel identification systems must contain a link to the NATO 
supply class.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Qualification"><p>The full 13-digit NATO stock number must be used to identify all materiel assets which have a repetitive, recurring, 
or continuing supply requirement within the federal government. Where a full 13-digit NATO number is not viable or for unique 
or small ticket items, materiel should be identified by the NATO stock class (the first four digits of the
<abbr title="NATO Stock Number">NSN</abbr>), along with the manufacturer's or supplier's name, and the part's or model's 
number.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Implementation"><p>The effective date of this standard is 11 February 1993.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Specifications"><p>This TBITS adopts the Canadian component of standards listed in the "Allied Codification Publication No. 1 (A Cod P.1), 
NATO Manual on codification" for use in government. The NATO standards are issued by the Materiel Management Systems Section, 
Defence Support Division, NATO Headquarters, Brussels. The Canadian component is named the Canadian Government Cataloguing 
System and is maintained by the Department of National Defence.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Government Standards Working Group"><p>Materiel coding</p><ul><li>K.F.
