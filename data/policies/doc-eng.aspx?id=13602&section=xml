			in January 1994. It was written to help managers and staff assess the management 
			of government information holdings (MGIH) in their own institutions. The Guide 
			will also help auditors and evaluators conduct formal reviews of the management 
			of government information. Throughout the Review Guide, the emphasis is on good 
			practices for managing information. Although the Guide excludes the main part 
			of the Management of Information Technology policy, it promotes the need to 
			establish linkages between information technology and information holdings.</p><p>The Review Guide was developed by the National Archives under the guidance of 
		an interdepartmental work group. Nearly forty officials in central agencies, lead 
		agencies and line departments commented on earlier drafts of the Review Guide. These 
		officials represented corporate policy planning, information collection, records 
		management, data management and library services functions, as well as audit and 
		evaluation and information management programs.</p><p>The management of information involves many information-based functions, including 
		corporate policy and planning, data management, telecommunications, office systems 
		and computer support, records management, library services, information collection, 
		forms management, access to information, and privacy. The management of information 
		also involves such media as paper, maps, photos, films, plans, videos, microfilms, 
		and tapes. Within an institution, therefore, a review could potentially cover a 
		broad range of functions and media.</p><p>Chapters four through eight of the Review Guide are based on the information 
		life cycle model: planning; collection, creation, and receipt; organization, transmission, 
		use and retrieval; storage, protection and retention; and disposition through transfer 
		or destruction. A review can cover any or all aspects of the information life cycle.</p><p>The Guide presents useful information to help institutions assess the effectiveness 
		of their implementation of the MGIH policy.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Acknowledgments"><p>The Guide was prepared by the National Archives of Canada under the direction 
		of the Interdepartmental Work Group on the Evaluation of Information Management 
		Policies. Work group participants were from Finance, Industry Science and Technology, 
		National Archives, National Defence, National Library, Office of the Comptroller 
		General, Revenue Canada, Taxation, Government Services Canada (formerly Supply 
		and Services) and Treasury Board. The Treasury Board Secretariat has an overall 
		interest in policy implementation and audit and evaluation. The National Library 
		of Canada has an interest in published material, and the Public Opinion Research 
		Group of Government Services Canada is concerned about information collection. 
		Groups from line departments contributed to a number of areas, including corporate 
		policy planning, information collection, records management, data administration, 
		library services, and audit and program evaluation.</p><p>The Guide also draws on the experience and ideas of individuals in the following

			the concept of information management: Records Management, Government Information 
			Collection and Public Opinion Research, Micrographics, EDP Records Management, 
			and Forms Management. This focuses attention on the importance of information 
			in supporting decision making and the delivery of programs and services. Information 
			also permits institutions to hold themselves accountable pursuant to legislative 
			and policy requirements. Information management is the coordinated management 
			of both information holdings and investments in information technology.</p><p>Information is a valuable resource and a critical factor in the achievement of 
			corporate objectives. Treasury Board Secretariat has recognized this in its publication 
			Enhancing Services: Through the Innovative Use of Information and Technology - Strategic 
			Direction for the 90s. Information management, including the planning, directing 
			and controlling of information holdings and investments in information technology, 
			is therefore important to help achieve corporate goals and to deliver programs and 
			services. The review of this important area, through self-assessment, or audit and 
			evaluation, is a good management practice.</p></section><section anchor="3.2" title="Purpose and Scope of the Guide"><p>As a concept, information management has many interpretations. For purposes 
			of this Guide, we will use the description of information management as discussed 
			in the Background section. The Treasury Board policies on the Management of 
			Government Information Holdings (MGIH) and Management of Information Technology 
			(MIT) are components of information management. The Treasury Board Foreword 
			on Information Management states that linkages between information technology 
			and information holdings should be established to the extent that they are useful 
			and meaningful. In this context, the Review Guide addresses the MGIH component 
			of information management, as well as the linkages to information technology. 
			(See Appendix C for an explanation of linkages to technology.) However, the 
			main part of the MIT policy is not addressed by the Guide.</p><p>The Guide was written to help government institutions review their management 
			of information practices. Specifically, it is intended to assist institutions in 
			self-assessment. Managers or staff may wish to review their own practices regarding 
			the management of information on a periodic basis. In addition, the Guide is intended 
			to assist auditors, evaluators and reviewers by serving as a tool for the planning 
			and conduct of reviews of the management of information.</p><p>The emphasis of the Guide is on good practices for the management of information. 
			This is reflected by the structure of the review chapters of the Guide which are 
			based on two key themes: management issues (chapter 3) and service to user issues 
			(chapters 4 through 8). Although references are made in the review chapters to the 
			MGIH policy, the Guide is not a compliance checklist. Reviewers will have to assess 
			the substance of their findings in order to draw conclusions about policy compliance 
			and performance (i.e., is the intent being achieved as well as the letter being 
			adhered to?).</p><p>The word information can have many meanings. For purposes of the Guide, the terms 
			"information" and "information holdings" are synonymous. (Appendix B provides a 
			glossary of definitions used for purposes of this Guide.) The emphasis of this Guide 
			is to promote the cost-effective and coordinated management of federal information 
			holdings. Throughout the Guide, the appropriate term is used in the context of the 
			particular law, policy or activity being discussed.</p><p>Note: This document is not intended to serve as a definitive guide to the review 
			of the management of information. Rather, it presents a basis for the review of 
			a broad area. Readers should supplement their review procedures according to the 
			nature and extent of the review planned. Appendix A provides many additional references 
			that a reviewer might use to supplement this Guide.</p><p>If readers have any questions regarding the content or use of this Guide, they 
			should contact the Information Management Standards and Practices Division, Archives 
			and Government Records Branch, National Archives.</p></section><section anchor="3.3" title="Roles and Responsibilities"><p>The information management policies refer to many stakeholders. A reviewer 
			should be cognizant of the roles and responsibilities of these stakeholders 
			in terms of their relationship to, and impact on, the institution. Stakeholders 
			include the following:</p><p>The institution is responsible and accountable for implementation of the MGIH 
			policy. Management must designate a senior official to represent the institution 
			for purposes of the MGIH policy. The infrastructure of institutional policies and 
			procedures for the management of information should establish operating requirements 
			that reflect the MGIH policy. The operating requirements should give direction to 
			program managers and functional specialists, and provide guidance concerning the 
			organization, description, use and retrieval, as well as the storage, protection, 
			retention and disposal of the institution's information holdings. Everybody in the 
			institution has some responsibility for the management of its information holdings.</p><p>Treasury Board Secretariat, Administrative Policy Branch, is accountable for 
			the development and general interpretation of the MGIH policy, and for evaluating 
			the policy to ensure its integrity and continued relevance, its effectiveness in 
			achieving the stated objectives, and the policy's appropriateness in the context 
			of overall government direction and changes in the management environment. The Branch 
			is also responsible for leadership and support of federal internal audit and program 
			evaluation groups. It provides advice and assistance to institutions, assesses audit 
			and evaluation practices, fosters a professional community for auditors and evaluators, 
			and oversees selected audits as well as central evaluations.</p><p>The Chief Informatics Officer for the federal government and the supporting Office 
			of Information Management, Systems and Technology have the responsibility to provide 
			a government-wide focus for the effective management of information technology. 
			This mandate includes the responsibility for directing the re-engineering of government 
			administrative processes and leading their cross-functional integration; establishing 
			the framework and actively supporting the re-engineering of the government's program 
			delivery mechanism; and developing policy and standards related to information management 
			and technology and related telecommunications activities.</p><p>National Archives has specific evaluation responsibilities on behalf of Treasury 
			Board Secretariat in regard to the MGIH policy. In addition, it may report on significant 
			problems or issues in the state of management of information holdings relevant to 
			their identification, organization, storage, conservation, retention and disposal. 
			It also has authority, under the National Archives of Canada Act, to control the 
			destruction and disposal of the information holdings of government institutions 
			(excluding published material), and the transfer of information of historic or archival 
			importance to the National Archives. Within the context of its mandate to facilitate 
			the management of government records and its leadership role in the management of 
			government information holdings, the National Archives leads the implementation 
			of the framework for evaluating the management of government information holdings. 
			The Archives performs this function in collaboration with Treasury Board Secretariat, 
			National Library, Public Opinion Research Group of Government Services, Canadian 
			Centre for Management Development, internal audit and program evaluation groups, 
			and information management groups of government institutions.</p><p>National Library is responsible for identifying, acquiring, recording and making 
			available Canada's published heritage, regardless of format. The major tool for 
			this responsibility is the national bibliography, Canadiana. Federal government 
			publications are an important part of Canada's heritage. The National Library also 
			acts as the central point for facilitating resource sharing among Canadian libraries. 
			The National Library fulfils this responsibility through union catalogues and lists 
			used to identify and locate library holdings for interlibrary loan. A number of 
			articles within the National Library Act refer directly to the coordination of federal 
			library activities including the disposal of surplus published materials. In addition, 
			the National Library has specific evaluation responsibilities related to published 
			material.</p><p>Internal Audit Groups are responsible for including in their audit of information 
			management an assessment of the degree of compliance with the MGIH Policy. This 
			is in addition to the customary responsibility of internal audit to assess the effectiveness 
			of the management framework in ensuring the achievement of operating objectives, 
			the economical and efficient use and protection of resources, and the integrity 
			of information.</p><p>Program Evaluation Groups are responsible for evaluating the continued relevance, 
			success and cost-effectiveness of federal programs. Where institutions provide information 
			to the public, or to groups outside the institution, program evaluation may look 
			at the provision of this information in terms of its relevance, success and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Public Opinion Research Group, Government Services Canada, is the central reporting 
			agency to which all proposals regarding information collection and public opinion 
			research must be sent. The POR Group is responsible for assessing the public opinion 
			content of the proposal, determining if approval by the Cabinet Committee on Operations 
			is required, and issuing authorization numbers allowing institutions to initiate 
			contracting procedures for approved projects.</p><p>Canadian Centre for Management Development provides advice and guidance to institutions 
			in developing institutional histories, case studies and profiles.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Chapter One"><section anchor="4.1" title="Management of Information"><p><strong>Overview Description</strong></p><p>Government by its very nature is an information-intensive service provider. 
			Good information management practices can enhance government productivity 
			and service quality, and decrease the cost of administration. Information 
			is increasingly recognized as an important primary resource - along with 
			finance, personnel and assets - that needs to be effectively managed. Hence, 
			awareness of the need for good practices in the management of information 
			is rising.</p><p>The other primary resources, i.e. finance, personnel and assets, usually have 
			a recognizable functional identity within an institution. If you have questions 
			regarding the management of finance or personnel or assets, you can usually find 
			someone - or some group - in the institution to deal with. In contrast, the management 
			of information is much more multidisciplinary. Information-based functions within 
			institutions include obvious groups such as records management, data management 
			and library services, as well as perhaps less obvious functions such as public opinion 
			research.</p><p>The multidisciplinary nature of the management of information leads to some challenging 
			planning and scoping issues, which are elaborated on later in the Guide. For purposes 
			of the Guide, information-based functions will be used as a generic term to include 
			the information management disciplines or functions involved. Another perspective 
			on the complex, multidisciplinary nature of the management of information is provided 
			by the variety of laws and policies that affect information. Figure 1 lists many 
			of them. In addition, some institutions have information-related legal and policy 
			requirements that relate to their particular missions. Reviewers should note that 
			some policies and regulations may take precedence over others, and they should look 
			to the particular circumstances of their institution before deciding on the hierarchy 
			of applicable authorities.</p><p><strong>Figure 1 - Managing Information in Canadian Government Institutions:</strong></p><p><strong>Legislation and Policy</strong></p><p><strong>Legislation</strong></p><p><em>Access to Information Act</em> and Regulations</p><p>Acts specific to each institution</p><p><em>Canada Evidence Act</em></p><p><em>Copyright Act</em></p><p><em>Emergency Preparedness Act</em> and the <em>Emergencies Act</em></p><p><em>National Archives of Canada Act</em></p><p><em>National Library Act</em></p><p><em>Official Languages Act</em></p><p><em>Privacy Act</em> and Regulations</p><p><strong>Treasury Board Policy</strong></p><p>Information Management volume of the Treasury BoardManual:</p><p>(a) Foreword</p><p>(b) Management of Government Information Holdings (MGIH)policy</p><p>(c) Management of Information Technology (MIT) policy</p><p>Government Security policy</p><p>Government Communications policy</p><p>Access to Information policy</p><p>Privacy policy</p></section><section anchor="4.2" title="Information Life Cycle Model"><p>Figure 2 provides a model to assist in the review of the management of information. 
			The model shows the stages information holdings pass through during their life 
			cycle.</p><p><strong>Figure 2 - Information Life Cycle Model</strong></p><ol><li>Planning</li><li>Collection, creation, receipt</li><li>Organization, transmission, use and retrieval</li><li>Storage, protection and retention</li><li>Disposition through transfer or destruction</li></ol><p>Each stage of the life cycle can be used as a basis to review an integral part 
			of the management of information holdings (see Chapters 4 through 8). In addition, 
			a review can look at the overall management framework, i.e. the management of the 
			entire life cycle and the context in which it operates (see Chapter 3).</p><p>Whether at the corporate or program level, an organization uses the information 
			life cycle as a framework within which to manage its information. Increasingly, 
			organizations are considering their requirements for information along with their 
			requirements for people, accommodation and financial resources.</p><p><strong>1. Planning</strong></p><p>The planning stage involves assessing how to meet the needs of the institution 
			for operational, legislative and policy purposes. The MGIH policy states that 
			institutions should identify their information needs as early as possible in 
			the project or management cycle. In keeping with that concept, institutions 
			should collect, create or generate only what information they require. They 
			should also make sure the information does not already exist in the institution 
			or that it is readily accessible to the institution. Information should be kept 
			only as long as it is of value. In addition, when planning information systems, 
			or making enhancements to existing information systems, institutions should 
			identify and include all the important parameters related to MGIH.</p><p>In the planning stage, institutions should identify their own information needs 
			for each of the stages in the information life cycle. The subsequent collection, 
			creation and/or generation of information should be directly linked to the needs 
			that have been identified. The information holdings that result should be organized, 
			stored and protected. Finally, information of no further use or value to the institution 
			should be disposed of pursuant to provisions of <em>the National Archives of Canada 
			Act</em> and the <em>National Library Act</em>.</p><p><strong>2. Collection, creation, receipt</strong></p><p>As stated above, planning should determine what information should be collected, 
			created or received, based on operational needs and legislative or policy requirements. 
			This suggests that generating or gathering of information should be articulated 
			in terms of the nature of information needed (what), its operational, legislative 
			or policy purpose (why), which persons or groups of the institution will have 
			custody and use of the information (who), the frequency of need (when), and 
			whether it is to be generated internally or gathered from other sources (where 
			and how).</p><p>Treasury Board's MGIH policy states some additional requirements concerning the 
			collection of information. Government institutions are required to avoid collecting 
			information that is already available, minimize the response burden and costs associated 
			with collection, and collect personal information in accordance with the Privacy 
			Act. In addition, in the case of public opinion research, institutions must seek 
			approval of the Cabinet Committee on Operations through the Public Opinion Research 
			Group of Government Services Canada.</p><p><strong>3. Organization, transmission, use and retrieval</strong></p><p>In order to maximize the value of information holdings, they should relate 
			to the needs of the institution. Consequently, institutions should identify 
			and describe their information holdings to meet their operational requirements 
			(decision making and program delivery) and to meet legislative or policy requirements. 
			Description provides context and meaning. Information holdings also should be 
			organized or arranged in a logical manner that facilitates access by users. 
			In this regard, access includes transmission, use and retrieval.</p><p>In the transmission, use and retrieval of information, users should respect the 
			applicable legal and policy constraints, including the access to information and 
			privacy legislation, and the Government Security policy. In addition, the MGIH policy 
			requires that information holdings of government institutions be identified in appropriate 
			government public reference sources and that information holdings be available to 
			the public and for use within the government - subject to legal and policy constraints.</p><p>In addition, institutions must recognize the importance of having qualified people 
			and the right equipment to facilitate the transmission, use and retrieval of information. 
			These two factors - the human and physical resources - can greatly affect the value 
			of information holdings, particularly in rendering information available to users.</p><p><strong>4. Storage, protection and retention</strong></p><p>Information of continuing relevance to the business of the institution should 
			be stored in media appropriate to the characteristics of the information. That 
			is, the media chosen (paper, books, microfilm, computer diskettes, magnetic 
			computer tape, etc.) should be selected to facilitate user accountability, the 
			length of time required to satisfy business needs, and archival or historical 
			requirements. To preserve the corporate memory, information holdings need to 
			be protected against unauthorized loss, access, use, alteration, destruction 
			or alienation (i.e., transfer outside the control of the government).</p><p>Institutions keep information holdings as long as they are useful for decision 
			making, program operations and service delivery. As well, the requirement under 
			MGIH to retain information holdings that serve to reconstruct the evolution of policy 
			and program decisions should guide institutions in this matter.</p><p><strong>5. Disposition through transfer or destruction</strong></p><p>The corporate memory of the Government of Canada includes all government 
			information holdings which are created, collected or received by government 
			institutions to meet their operational needs and the requirements of legislation 
			and policy. These information holdings should be disposed of through destruction 
			or by transfer to the control of the National Archives or National Library when 
			institutions have no further operational need or legislative or policy requirement 
			for keeping the information holdings, and when authority for disposal has been 
			granted by the National Archives or the National Library.</p></section><section anchor="4.3" title="Key Attributes of Information"><p>Six attributes relating to the quality of information which are useful as 
			a basis to review and assess the management of information within institutions 
			are listed in Figure 3. While these attributes are presented as separate items 
			for descriptive and analytic purposes, they are interrelated.</p><ol><li>Available</li><li>Understandable</li><li>Useable</li><li>Complete</li><li>Accurate</li><li>Up-to-date</li></ol><p><strong>1. Available</strong></p><p>Throughout their life cycle, information holdings should be available to those 
			who require them. This means that information - regardless of the medium used - 
			must be accessible to users, for retrieval and use when they need it. In short, 
			information must be accessible on a timely basis. Where information technology is 
			used for storage or transmission, the technology should be available to users in 
			order to facilitate retrieval and use of information.</p><p><strong>2. Understandable</strong></p><p>To be of any use, information holdings need to be understandable. This means 
			that identification and description of information holdings must be meaningful to 
			users. For example, technical information described in abbreviated terms understood 
			by technical experts may not be understood by other users.</p><p><strong>3. Useable</strong></p><p>Information needs to be useable by those who require it. This means that the 
			information must relate to the purposes for which it was created, collected or received. 
			In other words, the content must be applicable or relevant to users. In addition, 
			the information must be in a form that can be used by the persons who need to use 
			it. Both the content and form of information should provide for efficient and effective 
			use of information holdings.</p><p><strong>4. Complete</strong></p><p>Users may need a variety of information in support of decision making or program 
			delivery. Information holdings should be able to meet the needs of every program 
			within the institution.</p><p><strong>5. Accurate</strong></p><p>Information needs to be correct. The accuracy of information can affect decision 
			making and program delivery.</p><p><strong>6. Up-to-date</strong></p><p>Another attribute of the quality of information is whether or not it is up-to-date. 
			Information holdings need to contain the most current information relevant to user 
			needs. A lack of up-to-date information can impair decision making and program delivery. 
			Anyone planning to collect or create information should take into consideration 
			the requirements for keeping the information up-to-date.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Chapter Two"><section anchor="5.1" title="Planning a Review of Management of Information"><p><strong>General Issues</strong></p><p>A review of the management of information may include any or all of the following 
		components: management and coordination (Chapter 3); information planning (Chapter 
		4); collection, creation, receipt (Chapter 5); organization, transmission, use and 
		retrieval (Chapter 6); storage, protection and retention (Chapter 7); and disposition 
		through transfer or destruction (Chapter 8). A review of the management of information 
		could also be part of a larger review, where it is a subset of a review of many 
		other management issues.</p><p>In addition to the components covered in Chapters 3 through 8, it is important 
		that a review of the management of information also consider the quality of people 
		(human resources) and the adequacy of equipment (physical resources) involved. Further, 
		the attributes of information (discussed in Chapter 1) can be used as a basis to 
		analyze and comment on the management of information.</p><p>Some of the general issues and questions that can be addressed in a review are 
		listed below, along with a reference to the relevant chapter of the Guide.</p><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" class="widthFull"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><p><strong>Issue</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><p><strong>Question</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><p><strong>Reference</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="alignTop"><p>1.

		information management policies. However, this terminology may differ from that 
		used within individual government institutions. Therefore, users of this Guide are 
		reminded that titles, activity descriptions and other terms within their institutions 
		may be defined differently. For example, the terms "computer support," "informatics" 
		and "information systems management" may be used by different organizations to mean 
		the same thing. Clarity in the meaning of titles and terms will be important when 
		planning a review of the management of information.</p><p><strong>Diversity of Information-Based Functions and Information Media</strong></p><p>Management of information involves many functions as well as various media. Each 
			information-based function has its own detailed practices and procedures. Also, 
			characteristics of the storage media are quite different. For example, practices 
			for storage, protection and transmission of microfilm are quite different from those 
			for electronic media.</p><p>The issues to be examined and the level of detail required, depend upon the context 
			of the review. A review might look at some issues in the context of the MGIH policy 
			across various functions and media. For example, information retrieval could be 
			reviewed across all information-based functions and media. Alternatively, a review 
			might look at detailed issues pertaining to a particular function or to a particular 
			medium. For example, a review of the library function might look at specific aspects 
			of the handling of books and periodicals. This may require a much more detailed 
			and specific set of review objectives, criteria and questions/practices in order 
			to supplement those set out in this Guide.</p><p>It will be useful to identify which functions and which media will be included 
			in the scope of a review. A review of MGIH might cover some or all of the following:</p><ul><li>Corporate policy and planning</li><li>Data management</li><li>Telecommunications</li><li>Office systems and computer support</li><li>Records management</li><li>Library services</li><li>Information collection</li><li>Public opinion research</li><li>Forms management</li><li>Access to information</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Security</li><li>Ministers' offices (refer to MGIH Guideline 9 and the National Archives 
				Act)</li></ul><p>If managed outside the above-mentioned functions, a review of MGIH will include 
			the management of records or published material in the following media:</p><ul><li>paper</li><li>maps</li><li>photos</li><li>films</li><li>plans</li><li>videos</li><li>microfilms</li><li>tapes</li></ul><p><strong>Type of Review Performed</strong></p><p>The Guide does not differentiate between "self assessment," "internal audit" 
			or "program evaluation" issues. It is left to reviewers to decide whether or not 
			to cover specific issues and in what context this will be done. The review of some 
			issues will, however, be viewed as critical by National Archives for purposes of 
			its evaluation and reporting responsibilities under the MGIH policy. Specifically, 
			National Archives is concerned with the identification, organization, storage, conservation, 
			retention and disposal of information holdings. Hence, institutions should discuss 
			the scope of their reviews with National Archives before undertaking them. Likewise, 
			where reviews will cover published materials, institutions should discuss the scope 
			of reviews with National Library before undertaking them.</p><p><strong>Magnitude of Information-Based Functions</strong></p><p>Particularly in large departments, a review of the management of information 
			may or may not include all components of the functions under review. A review should 
			examine those components of a function, or issues, which are important to the institution 
			as indicated by the reviewer's risk assessment or analysis. Consequently, reviewers 
			may choose to include only certain aspects in a particular review.</p><p>Thus it is important to identify the scope of the review so that readers of the 
			review report will understand what is included and excluded. Presumably, other major 
			components of the function which are excluded from a current review would be included 
			in some other review(s).</p><p><strong>Level of Focus</strong></p><p>A review can be conducted at different levels within an institution. It might 
			examine only centralized functions (at headquarters), or only decentralized functions 
			(in the regions), or both. Similarly, a review might cover only the corporate level 
			or the branch level, or both. An additional dimension is whether a review would 
			be performed on the basis of an institution's organization chart or whether the 
			review would be conducted on a functional basis (i.e., functions which cut across

		accessibility, and transmission; its storage, protection and retention; and, finally, 
		its disposition through transfer to National <strong>Archives or National Library, 
		or destruction.</strong></p><p><strong>Management framework:</strong> The framework of interrelated systems 
		and practices adopted by management to achieve established objectives. The management 
		framework includes built-in control systems that provide reasonable assurance to 
		management that the specified objectives will be achieved.</p><p><strong>Management of information holdings:</strong> Ensuring the planning, needs 
		assessment, collection, creation, organization, maintenance and transmission of 
		information which has quality, relevance, integrity, accessibility and currency, 
		and includes its protection, retention, and proper disposal or archival preservation.(*)</p><p><strong>Published material:</strong> An information product which has been created 
		and edited for the purpose of distribution or sale. Material published by or for 
		government institutions is deposited in federal library collections.(*)</p><p><strong>Public opinion research:</strong> Any research that solicits the views 
		of any segment of the public, including advertising research.(*)</p><p><strong>Record:</strong> Any correspondence, memorandum, book, plan, map, drawing, 
		diagram, pictorial or graphic work, photograph, film, microform, sound recording, 
		videotape, machine readable records, and any other documentary material, regardless 
		of physical form or characteristics and any copy thereof. (National Archives of 
		Canada Act.)</p><p>Thesaurus function: An arrangement of classification terms or identifiers that 
		can be used for indexing, searching and information retrieval. A thesaurus function 
		brings classification terms or identifiers together based on logical relationships, 
		e.g. synonymous words, related subject matters and hierarchical relationships.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B: References"><p>In a review of the management of information holdings, reference must be made

		Management says that linkages between information technology and information holdings 
		should be established to the extent that they are useful and meaningful.</p><p>For purposes of the MGIH policy, linkages between information technology and 
		information holdings can be made where technology is used for information management 
		in an operational sense or to meet legislative or policy requirements. Consequently, 
		some institutions may have to distinguish between information technology for such 
		purposes and information technology for other purposes.</p><p>An obvious example would be a major office automation system which processes, 
		stores and transmits information to users. In this case, the technology should be 
		linked to the support requirements of the information holdings to ensure that all 
		key attributes of information are met (i.e., the information is available, understandable, 
		useable, complete, accurate and up-to-date). In addition, the technology should 
		assist in meeting all applicable legislative and policy requirements such as privacy 
		and protection. For example, the technology used may have to ensure that access 
		to and retrieval of some information can be restricted to certain authorized users.</p><p>In many institutions, most of the information technology acquired and used is 
		related to the processing, storage, communication and use of information for management, 
		program delivery and accountability purposes. In these cases, the information technology 
		is linked to the management of information holdings.</p><p>In some institutions, however, much of the information technology acquired and 
		used has little or no such application. Instead, the technology is used for other 
		purposes, such as controlling and guiding machinery and equipment. For example, 
		the heating, cooling, elevator and security systems of most major buildings are 
		computer controlled. In fact, a great proportion of electric and mechanized equipment 
		is computer assisted, ranging from smaller things like wood lathes and gas chromatographs 
		to larger items like wind tunnels, ships and aircraft. In maintaining, refitting 
		or upgrading such equipment, some institutions make substantial expenditures on 
		information technology.</p><p>It can be argued that a "number-crunching" computer used for scientific research 
		and the navigational control system of a vessel are in fact processing information, 
		and thus the term information technology is appropriate to them. While the purpose 
		of this technology is quite different than that of an office automation system, 
		both are described as information technologies for the purposes of Treasury Board 
		policies.</p><p>It should also be noted that some technology purchases related to the management 
		of information may not be categorized as information technology, because they are 
		not computer related. For example, a microfilm reader and photocopier can also be 
		called information technology, but they might be procured under an office equipment 
		budget, not the information technology budget. This kind of equipment should also 
		be linked to information holdings in terms of ensuring that all key attributes of 
		information are met.</p><p>Linkages between information technology and information holdings should be made 
		when technology is used to support information holdings. The linkages should identify 
		how technology is contributing to the economic, efficient and effective management 
		of information holdings.</p><p></p></appendix></appendices></doc>
