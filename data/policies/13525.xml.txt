Context"><p>3.1	Transfer payments are monetary payments, or transfers of goods, services or assets to third parties, including Crown corporations, on the basis of an appropriation. Transfer payments do not result in the acquisition by the Government of Canada of any goods, services or assets.</p><p>3.2	Transfer payments represent a large part of the Government of Canada's spending. Their tangible results touch the lives of Canadians and others every day, and cover all sectors of society. Transfer payments include grants, contributions and other transfer payments including those made to other orders of government, international organizations and Aboriginal peoples.</p><p>3.3	Transfer payments are one of the government's key instruments in furthering its broad policy objectives and priorities. They enable and engage a wide diversity of skills and resources outside the federal government that are well-placed to further Canadian aims, contribute to building a strong society and a competitive nation that is inclusive and respectful of Canadian values and Canada's linguistic duality.</p><p>3.4	Cabinet determines when transfer payment programs are the most appropriate policy instrument. Cabinet also determines the objectives and outcomes to be achieved by means of transfer payments within legislative authorities provided by Parliament.</p><p>3.5	Transfer payments are a major commitment of federal government resources. As such, they are subject to periodic spending reviews, such as strategic reviews. These reviews support improved management of the government's resources and their regular alignment with federal priorities and services.</p><p>3.6	The government is committed to ensuring that transfer payments are managed in a manner that respects sound stewardship and the highest level of integrity, transparency, and accountability. Moreover, the government is resolved to ensuring that transfer payment programs are designed, delivered and managed in a manner that is fair, accessible and effective for all involved – departments, applicants and recipients – all of whom have important contributions to make in achieving the objectives of the government and in furthering Canadian aims.</p><p>3.7	Supporting strengthened accountability for public monies and better results for Canadians, this policy requires that transfer payments be managed in a manner that is sensitive to risks, that strikes an appropriate balance between control and flexibility, and that establishes the right combination of good management practices, streamlined administration and clear requirements for performance.</p><p>3.8	This policy sets out clear roles and responsibilities for the Treasury Board, the President of the Treasury Board, the Secretary of the Treasury Board, ministers and deputy heads in the design, delivery and management of transfer payment programs.</p><p>3.9	Additional mandatory requirements are set out in directives dealing with grants, contributions and other transfer payments.</p><p>3.10	Treasury Board has delegated authority to the President of the Treasury Board to issue, amend or rescind any directive in support of this policy and to approve any exception to the directives as is deemed necessary.</p><p>3.11 This policy is issued under subsection 7(1) of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act</a></em>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.
