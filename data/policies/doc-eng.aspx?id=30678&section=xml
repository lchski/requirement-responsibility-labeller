Introduction"><section anchor="2.1" title="2.1	The Government of Canada's Approach to Identity Assurance"><p>Identity is at the core of most government business processes and is the starting point of trust and confidence in interactions between the public and government. Once the identity information of an individual is established, all subsequent government activities, ranging from providing services to granting benefits and status, rely on the accuracy and rightful use of this information. For many service encounters or client transactions, government organizations must ensure that they are dealing with the right individual so that they can meet their program and service delivery objectives. For example, when an individual applies for a Canadian passport, certain documents are required to support the proof of his or her identity.</p><p>The management of identity information is a shared responsibility between the different orders of government within Canada. There are many authoritative sources, enabled by federal, provincial and territorial acts and regulations, that record information relating to an individual such as vital events, legal or professional status, and benefit entitlements. In most cases, a document or certificate is issued to the individual, who uses to it prove his or her identity and related personal information.</p><p>In Canada, there is no single document whose sole purpose is to identify an individual. Instead, many documents issued by different jurisdictions are in use. This decentralized approach has been effective in serving Canadians. However, it can present challenges in providing a consistent service experience across jurisdictions and in combatting fraudulent activity.</p><p>Physical documents remain the predominant method of presenting evidence of identity for Government of Canada programs and services. As digital delivery methods become more prevalent, digital representations of identity may be accepted as alternatives to physical documents. Governments are recognizing the potential cost savings related to the use of digital alternatives and common infrastructure. As government programs and services become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, it becomes imperative to manage identity risk collaboratively across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries.</p><p>In 2011, in response to this changing environment, the Government of Canada published <a href="/sim-gsi/docs/2011/fimgc-fgigc/fimgc-fgigctb-eng.asp"><em>Federating Identity Management in the  Government of Canada: A Backgrounder</em></a>, which described an overall vision and approach that would permit trust, established by internal identity management business processes, to be extended across organizational boundaries within the Government of Canada and with other jurisdictions. As part of this document, several key concepts were formally defined, including "identity assurance" and "credential assurance," and then formalized in subsequent Treasury Board policy instruments. </p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="2.2 Treasury Board Policy Instruments on Identity"><p>The Treasury Board policy instruments on identity consist of one directive, one standard and two guidelines issued under the authority of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578"><em>Policy on Government Security</em></a>. </p><ul><li>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16577"><em>Directive on Identity  Management</em></a>, in effect since July 2009, supports effective identity management practices by outlining requirements to support departments in the establishment, use and validation of identity.</li><li>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26776"><em>Standard on Identity and  Credential Assurance</em></a>, in effect since February 2013, ensures that identity risk is managed consistently and collaboratively within the Government of Canada and with other jurisdictions and industry sectors. The standard is supported by two guidelines.</li><li>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26262"><em>Guideline on Defining  Authentication Requirements</em></a>, issued in November 2012, supports the implementation of requirements 6.1.1, 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 of the <em>Standard on Identity and Credential Assurance</em>. For ease of reference, these requirements are as follows:
		<ul><li><strong>6.1.1</strong> Identifying and evaluating identity and credential risks using an assessment of harms related to a program, activity, service or transaction;</li><li><strong>6.1.2</strong> Determining required identity and credential assurance levels using the standardized assurance levels specified in Appendix B [of the standard]; and</li><li><strong>6.1.3</strong> Selecting identity and credential controls for achieving assurance level requirements using the standardized assurance levels specified in Appendix B [of the standard].</li></ul></li><li>The Guideline on Identity Assurance (this guideline) supports the implementation of requirement 6.1.4 of the standard:
		<ul><li><strong>6.1.4</strong> Ensuring that the minimum requirements for establishing an identity assurance level as specified in Appendix C [of the standard] are met. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Section 3 of this guideline provides detailed guidance on meeting these requirements.</p></section><section anchor="2.3" title="2.3	Identity Assurance and Identity Assurance Levels"><p>Most government programs and services need to know the individual they are dealing with. For external services, the individual is typically a client of a government program or service. For internal services, the individual is an employee, or a government worker acting on behalf of a government organization. </p><p>These different contexts may result in different risks that need to be managed. For example, not properly confirming the right individual as a client may result in a benefits payment to the wrong individual (a program integrity risk). Not confirming the right individual as an employee may result in the unauthorized disclosure of information (an information security risk or privacy breach, should personal information be disclosed). Regardless of the context, managing the risk of ensuring that a government organization is dealing with the right individual can be achieved consistently and coherently by means of identity assurance. </p><p>By definition, "identity assurance" is a measure of certainty (or a degree of confidence) that an individual, organization or device is who or what it claims to be. Identity assurance is used to answer the question, "How sure are you that you have the right individual, organization or device?<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></p><p>In addition to managing risk, a standardized approach to identity assurance allows people to interact with government programs or services that use, or rely on, identity establishment processes carried out elsewhere. For example, an individual may prove who he or she is once, according to standardized requirements, and the established identity for this individual can be relied on by many other programs and services. This is the essence of federation, which is discussed in subsection 3.9 of this document. </p><p>Different identity assurance levels allow government programs and services to carry out transactions commensurate with the level of risk. For some services, the level of risk is low; for others, it is higher. For example, the level of risk involved in providing personalized weather information to an individual is low, whereas the level of risk involved in accepting an application for a passport is higher.</p><p>The different identity assurance levels also allow government organizations to manage costs and to design optimal solutions using standardized services or capabilities developed for different (or lower) assurance levels while appropriately managing the residual risk.</p><p><strong>Table 1</strong> shows the identity assurance levels defined in the <em>Standard on Identity and Credential Assurance</em>. </p><table class="table table-bordered small  table-condensed"><caption><strong>Table 1: Identity Assurance Levels</strong></caption><thead><tr class="label-default active"><th class="text-center" scope="col">Level</th><th class="text-center" scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th class="label-default active" scope="row">4</th><td><p><strong>Very high confidence required that an individual is who he or she claims to be.<br /></strong>Compromise could reasonably be expected to cause serious to catastrophic harm.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="label-default active" scope="row">3</th><td><p><strong>High confidence required that an individual is who he or she claims to be.</strong><br />

Guidelines for Implementing an Identity Assurance Level"><section anchor="3.1" title="3.1 Conducting an Assurance Level Assessment"><p>An assurance level assessment should be conducted first to determine the assurance level requirement. The companion guidance document, <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26262"><em>Guideline on Defining Authentication Requirements</em></a>, defines a two-step process that assists in determining this requirement. </p><p>Figure 1 presents an overview of the assurance level assessment and IT design processes in terms of the scope of the related Government of Canada guidelines.</p><p><strong>Figure 1.

The assurance level assessment is conducted using the worksheet in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26262&amp;section=text#appA">Appendix  A of the <em>Guideline on Defining  Authentication Requirements</em></a>. </li></ul><h4>Step 2</h4><ul><li><strong>Determine authentication options</strong> that will be used to achieve the assurance level requirement determined in Step 1. These authentication options are:
		<ol><li><strong>Identity assurance level requirement</strong> specifies the minimum requirements to establish the identity of an individual for a given level of assurance. The identity assurance level requirement is the primary input into this guideline. </li><li><strong>Credential assurance level requirement </strong>specifies the minimum requirements to ensure that an individual has maintained control over a credential issued to him or her and that the credential has not been compromised. The guidelines for implementing these requirements are set out in CSE's ITSG (Information Technology Security Guideline)-31, <a href="https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/group-groupe/its-advice-and-guidance"><em>User Authentication Guidance for IT Systems</em></a>.</li><li><strong>Authentication requirements</strong> are the minimum technical design or business process requirements that are necessary to carry out an electronic or manual authentication process. The guidelines for implementing these requirements are set out in CSE's ITSG-31and ITSG-33, <a href="https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/publication/itsg-33"><em>IT Security Risk Management: A Lifecycle Approach</em></a>. </li></ol></li></ul><p>The <em>Guideline on Defining Authentication Requirements</em> also provides recommendations on other mechanisms for mitigating risk.</p><ul><li><strong>Compensating factors</strong> are additional measures that can be used during the authentication process to reduce a risk. A compensating factor is intended to mitigate the residual risks or to counter new threat possibilities. An example of a compensating factor is challenging an individual to answer additional questions when his or her credential is authenticated from a previously unknown device or location.</li><li><strong>Other safeguards</strong> are other controls put in place to manage risk or to ensure program integrity.  Other safeguards may be security control mechanisms used in processes subsequent to authentication or indicators that are used to initiate exceptions or interventions.</li></ul></section><section anchor="3.2" title="3.2 Identity Assurance Level Requirements"><p>This subsection provides detailed guidance on implementing the requirements specified in Appendix C of the <em>Standard on Identity and Credential Assurance</em>. </p><p>There are four categories of requirements to establish an identity assurance level. These four categories are listed below with a high-level control objective statement and a brief description. </p><dl><dt><strong>Uniqueness</strong>. <em>An identity must be unique</em>. </dt><dd>Uniqueness ensures that individuals can be distinguished from one another and, when required, uniquely identified. Uniqueness is also used to determine identity information requirements.</dd><dt><strong>Evidence of identity</strong>. <em>Evidence of identity must support the claims made by an individual.</em></dt><dd>Evidence of identity supports the integrity and accuracy of the claims made by an individual. The amount of evidence needed to confirm the accuracy of the identity information and its linkage to the individual depends on the assurance level requirement determined by the program or service. The <em>Standard on Identity and Credential Assurance</em> defines two categories of evidence of identity: foundational evidence of identity and supporting evidence of identity (see subsection 3.4 of this document).</dd><dt><strong>Accuracy of identity information</strong>. <em>Identity information about an individual must be accurate, complete and up to date.</em></dt><dd>Accuracy ensures the quality of identity information - the information represents what is true about the individual and is complete and up to date. Accuracy can be confirmed by using an authoritative source or by corroborating different sources of information when no authoritative source is available.</dd><dt><strong>Linkage of identity information to the individual</strong>. <em>Identity information must relate to the individual making the claim.</em></dt><dd>Linkage ensures that identity information relates to the individual making the claim, that it does not relate to another individual, and that it reflects how the individual is known within a community or is legally recognized within a jurisdiction.</dd></dl><p>For ease of reference, Table 2 is reproduced from <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26776&amp;section=text">Appendix  C of the <em>Standard on Identity and  Credential Assurance</em></a>.

Uniqueness reduces the possibility of an individual receiving a service or benefit intended for someone else. </p><p>Uniqueness is required when a service must deliver an output or benefit to a specific individual—for example, the <strong>same</strong> individual from a previous registration or enrolment process. In some cases the identity of the individual may not be required or desired, such as the identity of a survey respondent.</p><p>Uniqueness, on its own, does not determine eligibility or entitlement for a service or benefit. However, information that is collected to determine uniqueness may also be used for eligibility or entitlement purposes and may therefore be subject to other legislative and privacy requirements. In cases where a transaction has two or more purposes (for example, to determine identity and entitlement), the intended uses of the information need to be clear.</p><h4>3.3.2 Defining Identity Context</h4><p>In delivering programs and services, government organizations operate within a certain environment or set of circumstances known as the identity context. Identity context is further defined by factors such as mandate, target population (clients) and responsibilities prescribed by legislation or agreements.</p><p>Understanding and defining identity context assists government organizations in determining uniqueness requirements. Identity context helps establish what identity information is required, and what information is not required. It also helps determine commonalities with other government organizations or jurisdictions, and whether identity information or assurance processes can be used across contexts.</p><p>Identity context may be considered from the perspective of the individual, the federal organization or the Government of Canada. For example, an identity context may be the set of external services to citizens, or the set of internal services to employees. </p><p>It is recommended that government organizations keep the following in mind when defining or specifying the identity context of a given program or service:</p><ul><li>Intended recipient of a service. Recipients may be external to the federal government (for example, citizens, businesses, non-Canadians, non-profit organizations), or internal to the federal government (for example, departments);</li><li>Size, characteristics and composition of the client population;</li><li>Commonalities with other services across government;</li><li>Government organizations with similar mandates; and</li><li>Use of shared services.</li></ul><h4>3.3.3	Defining Identity Information</h4><p>The term "identity" is defined in the <em>Standard on Identity and Credential Assurance</em> as a reference or designation used to distinguish a unique and particular individual, organization or device<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>. </p><p>Identity information is considered to be valid within a defined identity context (see subsection 3.3.2). Within an identity context, it is critical to be able to distinguish individuals from one another so that services can be delivered to the right individuals. </p><p>Under the <em>Directive on Identity Management</em>, government organizations are responsible for ensuring the legitimacy of identity when</p><ul><li>unique identification of an individual, organization or device is required for the purposes of administering a federal program or service enabled by legislation; and </li><li>disclosure of identity information by the individual, organization or device is required for receiving a government service, participating in a government program, or becoming a member of a government organization<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>. </li></ul><p>A property or characteristic associated with an identifiable individual is typically referred to as an identity attribute or an identity data element. "Identity information" is understood to be the set of identity attributes that is both</p><ul><li>sufficient to distinguish between different individuals within an identity context; and</li><li>sufficient to describe the individual as required by the service or program.</li></ul><p>The identity attribute or the set of identity attributes used to distinguish a unique and particular individual, organization or device may also be referred to as an identifier. It is recommended that identity attributes used as identifiers be the same or continuous over time. In many cases continuity is not possible, and government organizations may choose instead to create or use an assigned identifier. This identifier is typically a numeric or alphanumeric string that is generated automatically, and that uniquely distinguishes between individuals and is independent of any other identity attributes. </p><p>Additional attributes may be used to further distinguish between similar individuals or to assist in the recognition of a particular individual. These attributes may not necessarily be unique to the individual (for example, hair colour, and height) or may change over time.</p><p>When defining or determining the sufficiency of identity information for a given service delivery context or program administration requirement, government organizations, for privacy reasons, should distinguish between identity information and program-specific personal information, which can overlap. This distinction ensures that the use of identity information is consistent with the original purpose for which the identity information was obtained and that it can be managed separately or protected by appropriate security and privacy controls<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>. </p><p>To minimize privacy risk, government organizations should reduce the overlap between identity information and program specific personal information as much as possible. However, when overlap is required, it is a good practice to describe both purposes. For example, date of birth can be used for uniqueness (as identity information) and for age eligibility (as program-specific personal information).</p><p>The following considerations apply when determining the sufficiency of identity information:</p><ul><li>Identity information that is intended to describe a real (existing) person or to distinguish one person from another is subject to accuracy of identity information requirements (see subsection 3.5).</li><li>For privacy and security reasons, such as protecting the identities of individuals, some identity attributes may be randomly assigned identifiers, pseudonymous identifiers, user identifiers or usernames.</li><li>Examples of identity information are name, date of birth, and sex, for individuals; business registration numbers, for organizations; and serial numbers and network identifiers, for telecommunications and computing devices.</li><li>An identifier may be a unique identity attribute assigned and managed by the program or service. </li><li>Assigned identifiers may be kept internal to the program or service. Examples of internal identifiers are database keys and universally unique identifiers.</li><li>Assigned identifiers may be provided to other programs; however, there may be restrictions owing to privacy considerations or legislation.</li><li>Existing or previously assigned identifiers that meet the uniqueness requirement may be used as identity information. Government organizations need to be aware that the use of these identifiers may be subject to restrictions or have privacy implications. </li><li>Certain identifiers may be subject to legal and policy restrictions. For example, the Directive on Social Insurance Number outlines specific restrictions on the collection, use, retention, disclosure and disposal of the Government of Canada Social Insurance Number. </li></ul></section><section anchor="3.4" title="3.4 Requirements  for Evidence of Identity"><p>Evidence of identity is an information record maintained by  an authoritative source that supports the integrity and accuracy of the claims  made by an individual. What constitutes sufficient evidence to support the  claims depends on the level of assurance required, as illustrated in Table 2.</p><h4>3.4.1 Foundational  and Supporting Evidence of Identity </h4><p>The <em>Standard on Identity and Credential Assurance</em> defines two  categories of evidence of identity:  </p><ul><li><strong>Foundational  evidence of identity </strong>establishes core identity information such as given  name(s), surname, date of birth, sex and place of birth. Examples are records  of birth, immigration and citizenship, from a vital statistics agency or  immigration authority.</li><li><strong>Supporting  evidence of identity</strong> corroborates the foundational evidence of identity and  assists in linking the identity information to an individual. It may also  provide additional information such as a photo, signature or address. Examples are  social insurance records; records of entitlement to travel, drive or obtain  health insurance; and records of marriage, death or name change originating  from a jurisdictional authority<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>When defining operational requirements or procedures, it is  a good practice to refer to documents specifically by name (for example,  passport, driver's licence), in keeping with their original purpose, rather  than generally as identity documents.</p><h4>3.4.2 Use of Evidence of Identity</h4><p>It is recommended that  government organizations use evidence of identity only for the following  purposes: </p><ul><li>To collect sufficient identity information about  an individual to ensure delivery of a program or service to the individual;</li><li>To determine that the identity information is  accurate, complete and up to date; and</li><li>To determine that the identity information is  linked to the individual making the claim.

Government organizations  need to ensure that any such additional use of information is supported by  legislation.</p><p>Evidence of identity may be  presented or accepted in the following forms:</p><dl><dt><strong>Documentary evidence</strong></dt><dd>is any physical record of information that can be used as evidence (widely understood to mean information written on paper, but includes non-paper evidence more generally).</dd><dt><strong>Electronic or digital evidence</strong></dt><dd>is any data recorded or preserved on any medium in or by a computer system or other similar device. Examples are database records, audit logs and electronic word processing documents.</dd></dl><p>The evidence of identity requirements specified in Table 3  are independent of the form in which the evidence is presented. Further, instances  of evidence of identity should originate from, or be issued by, different  authoritative sources. </p><h4>3.4.3 Acceptability Criteria for  Evidence of Identity</h4><p>Table 3 sets out the acceptability criteria for foundational  and supporting evidence of identity.

Providing  services to these individuals often involves special circumstances and  additional risk factors. For example, </p><ul><li>Children, minors and vulnerable individuals may  not have sufficient evidence of identity to meet the requirements specified in  the <em>Standard on Identity and Credential  Assurance</em>. </li><li>The applicant may not  be the recipient or beneficiary of the service. A parent, custodial parent or  legal guardian may be applying for a service or program on behalf of a child,  minor or other vulnerable  individual.
	</li></ul><p>It is recommended that  government organizations apply the following guidelines when providing services  to children, minors and other vulnerable individuals:</p><ul><li>Have in place additional safeguards or  compensating factors to reduce risk and to initiate exceptions or  interventions, as appropriate.</li><li>Confirm that the applicant (for example, a  parent or guardian) has the legal authority to carry out a request or obtain a  service on behalf of the child, minor or other vulnerable individual.</li></ul><p>A government program may decide to include evidence of  identity requirements for a parent or guardian as part of the evidence of  identity requirements for the child, minor or other vulnerable individual. For  example, the passport of a parent could be used as supporting evidence of  identity for the child.</p><p>Note that the recommendations in this subsection do not designate  the authorized representatives who may act for other individuals—for example,  parents acting for children, or lawyers acting for applicants. </p><h4>3.4.5 Guidelines on Evidence of Identity Assurance Levels</h4><p><strong>Table  4</strong> provides  guidelines for the assurance levels related to evidence of identity presented  in Table 3.

Identity information is expected to represent what is true about an individual,  and to be complete and up to date. To ensure the accuracy of identity  information, the following considerations apply:</p><ul><li><strong>The identity information is correct. </strong>Identity information  for certain life events, such as marriage, may change over time. To maintain  accuracy, identity information needs to be updated periodically.</li><li><strong>The identity information relates to a real individual</strong>. Identity information relates to an individual who actually exists. In most cases, the individual is still alive, but cases of deceased individuals may apply, since the individual's identity information does not cease to exist after death.</li><li><strong>The identity information relates to the correct individual. </strong>In large populations, some individuals may have the same or similar identity information—for example, name, sex and date of birth. Although the requirement for uniqueness addresses this issue, the possibility of relating identity information to the wrong individual remains.</li></ul><p>Identity validation is the process of confirming the  accuracy of identity information as established by an authoritative party<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>. Depending on the program or service requirements and the privacy  considerations, government organizations may validate identity information  using different authoritative sources. For example, a date of birth may be  electronically validated using a provincial vital statistics registry. </p><p>If validation using an authoritative source is not feasible,  other methods may be used, such as corroborating identity information using one  or more instances of evidence of identity. Government organizations are advised  to keep in mind the fraud considerations described in subsection 3.7.2.</p><p>Determining the accuracy of identity information involves confirming  that the individual currently exists or previously existed (was alive but is now  deceased). Identity information needs to relate to a real individual (living or  dead) and not to a non-existent or incorrect individual. </p><p>When the authoritative source is outside Canadian  jurisdiction, the accuracy of identity information may be determined through a  risk-managed approach.</p><p>Accuracy of identity information is independent of whether  an individual is living or deceased. An individual's identity information does  not cease to exist after death. In cases of death, it becomes important that an  individual's identity information is used properly by authorized individuals—for  example, by the surviving spouse or executor.</p><p>Factors such as spelling and phonetic variations, name  changes and different character sets can make determining the accuracy of  identity information challenging. Such factors may make it difficult to  prescribe exact match criteria. Government organizations may need to use  approximate or statistical matching methods to determine whether identity  information acceptably matches an authoritative record. </p><p>An assigned identifier (see subsection 3.3.3) should be  subject to an exact match. In cases where the integrity of an identifier can be  determined using a mathematical algorithm (for example, checksum), these  methods should be applied as part of the validation process.</p><p>Table 5 provides guidelines for requirements related to the accuracy  of identity information presented in Table 1.

The factors for managing identity risk may be outside  the organization’s direct control or the jurisdiction’s authority. For example,  a department may rely on documents to identify individuals, but it may not be  able to discern if these documents are stolen or fraudulent. </li><li>Impacts of identity risk go beyond a single  organization. An error or fraudulent activity having a low impact in one organization  may result in a higher impact in another organization. For example, a  fraudulently issued document in one department may be used to gain significant  benefits in another department.</li></ul><p>The following are some of the specific  risk factors related to the identity of individuals:</p><ul><li>An individual may be associated with incorrect  identity information; for example, two individuals may have identical names and  dates of birth. The result is a possible confusion of services and  entitlements. </li><li>Identity information may be inaccurate or out of  date. Life events, such as marriage,  may result in name changes. Data entry errors may result in the transposition  of dates and names.</li><li>Identity information may be asserted by parties that  cannot be determined to be reliable or authoritative. An individual, such as a newcomer or visitor to Canada, may  present identity information that is possibly accurate, but impossible to  validate against an authoritative source. </li><li>Identity information may be used by someone  other than its rightful owner or authorized representative, such as in the case  of an individual who uses the identity information of another individual. If  this use is intentional, it may be considered to be identity fraud under subsection  403(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</li><li>False documents may be used to substantiate  identity. An individual may use or modify a copy of a birth certificate that  was originally issued to another person and claim the identity. This is  considered identity fraud.</li><li>Documentation may be lacking. An individual may  have documents that cannot be determined to be genuine or cannot be validated  against an authoritative source.</li></ul><h4>3.7.2 Fraud Considerations</h4><p>Government organizations should be familiar with the  different methods of fraud, as these may present risks when implementing the  requirements of the <em>Standard on Identity  and Credential Assurance</em>.</p><p>Document fraud is the fraudulent  acquisition, production or alteration of documents issued by an authority. The  following are the techniques of document fraud:</p><ul><li><strong>Fabrication or counterfeiting of documents:</strong> The unauthorized   manufacture of documents using devices and processes available on the open   market or acquired by unauthorized means. It involves the simulation or   replication of the security or personalization features of an authentic   document.</li><li><strong>Alteration of legitimately issued documents:</strong> The unauthorized   alteration of an existing legitimate document. It may involve altering the   date of birth to change entitlements, or altering the photograph and   biographical data to correspond to a fraudulent bearer.</li></ul><p>Records fraud is the  unauthorized creation, insertion, alteration or deletion of authoritative  records under the control of an institution. The creation of false records or  the alteration of existing records may result in the issuance of documents or  entitlements that are not legitimate. The following are the techniques of  record fraud:</p><ul><li><strong>External threat agent: </strong>Unauthorized creation, insertion,   alteration or deletion of authoritative records as a result of external   threat agents that have intruded into the record system.</li><li><strong>Insider fraud or collusions: </strong>Unauthorized creation, insertion,   alteration or deletion of authoritative records by individuals in a   position of trust or with access to sensitive or personal information.</li></ul><p>Imposter fraud is the fraudulent  use of another person’s identity information, whether this person is real or  fictitious. Imposter fraud may involve the following activities:</p><ul><li><strong>Use of  another person’s evidence of identity, where the other person is a stranger</strong>.  To use another person’s identity, the imposter may alter his or her appearance  or may alter the evidence of identity. In these cases, the imposter usually  does not have detailed knowledge of the victim, and fraudulent use can be  detected using the confirmation methods described in subsection 3.6.1.</li><li><strong>Use of  another person’s evidence of identity, where the other person is known.</strong> The  fraudster may be acting as an imposter (as described above). The fraudster may  also be attempting to act on behalf of another individual by means of an  unauthorized role or relationship. Additional methods should be used to ensure that  an individual is legitimately acting on behalf of another individual.</li><li><strong>Use of  another person’s evidence of identity, where the other person is a fabricated  or synthetic identity. </strong>This is the most sophisticated type of fraud and may  be carried out in conjunction with records fraud and document fraud. Owing to  its sophistication, this type of fraud is usually carried out by highly  motivated threat agents such as organized crime.</li></ul></section><section anchor="3.8" title="3.8 Integration  Considerations"><p>Identity assurance level requirements are typically part of  a more comprehensive set of program or service requirements that are integrated  into a broader business or system process. This subsection presents  considerations for integrating identity assurance level requirements into  business or system processes. For example, one department may decide to integrate  these requirements into a client registration process to support a single  program. Another department may decide to implement the requirements by  creating an identity assurance process that can be incorporated into many  programs and services. </p><p>Regardless of the integration approach taken, government  organizations need to be able to demonstrate how they meet all of the  requirements for the identity assurance levels determined for their programs  and services. </p><p>When implementing the requirements  for identity assurance, it is recommended that government organizations consider  the following:</p><ul><li>The requirements are independent of the delivery  channel and the technology used. This independence supports the Government of  Canada’s commitment to multi-channel access and service delivery. </li><li>It is a good practice to consider channel and  service delivery alternatives that best suit the needs of clients, that enable  accessibility to people with a wide range of disabilities, and that encourage  adoption through trust and confidence.</li><li>The requirements may be implemented in  collaboration with other government organizations when considering federation (see  subsection 3.9).</li><li>When integrating the requirements of the <em>Standard on Identity and Credential  Assurance</em> into business or system processes, government organizations should  ensure that identity assurance procedures are as efficient, and transparent to  the client as possible. </li></ul></section><section anchor="3.9" title="3.9 Federation  Considerations"><p>A federation is a cooperative agreement between autonomous  entities that have agreed to work together. It can consist of public and  private sector organizations, different jurisdictions or different countries. Many  federations are informal in nature and are based on shared practices and  objectives that have been developed over time. As these informal federations mature,  the informal arrangements are replaced by agreed-on trust frameworks and assessment  processes that can include contractual agreements, service agreements, legal  obligations and dispute resolution mechanisms.</p><p>Federations become a compelling option when there is a  business need to provide online services seamlessly across departmental and  jurisdictional boundaries in a way that includes both public and private  service providers. Fulfilling this need requires a level of trust between different  kinds of organizations that have diverse mandates and act under different  authorities. A trust framework   stipulates  adherence to agreed-on standards, formalizes assessment processes, and defines the  roles and responsibilities within multi-party arrangements.</p><h4>3.9.1 Enabling a Pan-Canadian  Approach</h4><p>The Government of Canada is committed to assisting federal, provincial,  territorial and municipal partners in fulfilling their respective program and  service requirements, using trusted common processes.</p><p>The Government of  Canada is collaborating with jurisdictions to develop a pan-Canadian approach to  federating identity that respects the autonomy and the laws of the different  jurisdictions. In November 2014, the Federal, Provincial, Territorial  Deputy Ministers’ (FPT DM) Table on Service Delivery Collaboration approved the <em>Pan-Canadian Identity Validation Standard<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>,</em> which standardizes identity information and personal information validation  requests and responses between federal, provincial, territorial and municipal organizations. </p><p>It is recommended that government organizations incorporate  the <em>Pan-Canadian Identity Validation  Standard</em> into the implementation planning of their programs and services. </p><h4>3.9.2 Implementing a Federated Model</h4><p>This guideline can be used as a framework to help a government  organization transition to a federated model and rely on trusted services  provided by other organizations. Instead of implementing the requirements for  identity assurance on its own, a government organization may choose to adopt a  federated model. Before becoming a member of a federation, however, a government  organization should ensure that certain key elements of a federated model are implemented  within its own organizational context, specifically, the roles of authoritative  party and relying party. </p><p>An authoritative party is defined in the <em>Standard on Identity and Credential  Assurance</em> as a federation member that provides assurance (of credential or  identity) to other members (relying parties). A relying party is a federation  member who relies on assurances (of credential or identity) from other members  (authoritative parties). One unit of an organization may assume the role of an  authoritative party while the other units take on the role of relying parties. For  example, a departmental human resources (HR) system could play the part of the  authoritative party regarding employee information, while the departmental  security system responsible for issuing employee identification cards takes on  the role of the relying party.</p><p>Table 8 outlines key considerations for taking on the roles of authoritative party and  relying party.</p><table class="table table-bordered small  table-condensed"><caption><strong>Table 8.

The <em>Standard on Identity and  Credential Assurance</em>, as well as this guideline, will be an integral part  of this trust framework. Government organizations can be assured that the standard  and its implementation are designed to support the adoption of existing and  emerging trust frameworks.</p></section><section anchor="3.10" title="3.10 Other Policy and  Legislation Considerations"><p>When implementing the requirements for identity assurance,  government organizations should ensure compliance with other applicable policy  instruments or legislation. For example, another policy may require a  government organization to use a certain assigned identifier or may permit the collection  of only a defined set of attributes that can be used as identity information.</p><h4>3.10.1 <em>Privacy Act</em> and <em>Policy on  Privacy Protection</em></h4><p>When implementing identity assurance requirements, government  organizations must comply with the <em>Privacy  Act </em>and the <em>Policy on Privacy Protection. </em>Consideration needs to be given to the  right to the privacy of individuals, while ensuring access to their personal  information and maintaining its accuracy. </p><p>Information about an identifiable individual is considered  to be personal information and is therefore subject to the <em>Privacy Act.</em> Collecting, using, disclosing or disposing of identity  information must be in accordance with the <em>Privacy  Act</em> and departmental legislation. All identity information should be  considered to be a subset of “personal information,” as defined by the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Government organizations  are advised to consult with legal counsel to ensure that their management of  identity information is consistent with their enabling legislation.</p><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12510&amp;section=text"><em>Policy on Privacy Protection</em></a> and its  related privacy directives, standards and guidelines apply to identity  information. Government organizations are expected to identify, assess, monitor  and mitigate any privacy risks involved in the creation, collection, use,  retention, disclosure and disposal of identity information.</p><p>It is important that government organizations distinguish  between the information they collect to support identity assurance requirements  and other personal information that is collected, used, retained and disposed  of for a specific program or service. Failure to properly separate identity  information from program or service-specific information may have privacy  implications. This is a key consideration, for example, when identity  information is collected and used to support several related services.</p><p>Identity information may be collected, used, retained,  disclosed and disposed of as part of a larger business process, such as processing  registrations or determining entitlement. If the identity information is to be  derived from existing program-specific information, government organizations  need to ensure compliance with the <em>Policy  on Privacy Protection</em>. Compliance includes ensuring that the use of  identity information is consistent with the original purpose(s) for which the  information was obtained or compiled.</p><p>There are various means of protecting identity information,  such as separating records into different data repositories, encrypting data,  and substituting or mapping identifiers. Regardless of the mechanisms used, the  resulting information should be considered to be personal information.</p><h4>3.10.2 <em>Policy on Service</em></h4><p>Federal government organizations must comply with the <em>Policy on Service.</em> When implementing  identity assurance requirements, government organizations should consider  designing services that have a strong client orientation and that are integrated,  simple, timely and convenient.</p><p>Government organizations, as they develop new services and  transform existing services, are encouraged to think beyond document-based  processes and technology-specific implementations. To enable participation in a  broader identity management federation, government organizations are also  encouraged to standardize practices, processes and technologies that can be  extended beyond their own organizations in a manner that maintains trust and  integrity. </p><p>For more information on complying with service delivery  requirements, see the <em>Policy on Service</em>.</p><h4>3.10.3 <em>Criminal Code</em> of Canada</h4><p>Government organizations need to be familiar with and  understand the potential applicability of the following sections of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, including its definitions  of “identity document” and “identity information” as they apply in the context  of the Code. The relevant sections are listed below:</p><ul><li><strong>Subsections 56.1(1) and (2)</strong> regarding the use of identity documents relating to another person;</li><li><strong>Subsection 56.1(3)</strong> regarding the definition of “identity document,” as related to subsections 56.1(1) and 56.1(2);</li><li><strong>Subsections 57(1) to 57(6) </strong>regarding the use of the Canadian passport;</li><li><strong>Section 402.1</strong> regarding the definition of “identity information.” Note that this is a narrower definition of identity information for the purposes of sections 402.2 and 403 in relation to identity theft and identity fraud only;</li><li><strong>Section 402.2</strong> regarding the wrongful possession of identity information (identity theft); and </li><li><strong>Section 403</strong> regarding fraudulent personation of another person.</li></ul><h4>3.10.4  Other Policies and Legislation</h4><p>In addition to the policies and legislation discussed above,  government organizations should determine whether other policy instruments or  legislation may be applicable to their context. </p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.

For example, a security risk assessment may be useful in  addressing highly specialized threat agents associated with the rapidly  evolving online environment and the potential vulnerabilities introduced by  newer technologies—for example, tablets or mobile phones.</p><h4>IT Security Guidelines</h4><p>For guidance on authentication  related to IT systems and electronic service delivery, government organizations  are advised to consult the following guidelines published by CSE:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/publication/itsg-31"><em>ITSG-31-User Authentication Guidance for IT Systems</em></a>. This guideline provides guidance on the design and selection of user authentication solutions.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/publication/itsg-33"><em>ITSG-33-IT Security Risk Management: A Lifecycle Approach</em></a>. This guideline provides the framework for the IT security risk management activities that should be undertaken at both the departmental level and the information system level within government organizations. </li></ul><h4>Federation Standards and Protocols</h4><p>Several documents have been developed to support the governance  of, and contracting of services for, cyber authentication. Government  organizations may wish to consult these documents, which are available by  contacting the Chief Information Officer Branch (see subsection 5.2 of this guideline). </p><ul><li><em>Cyber-Authentication Technology Solutions Interface Architecture and Specification Version 2.0: Deployment Profile</em>. This document describes the deployment profile and messaging interface required for using Government of Canada credential authentication services.

The  Chief Information Officer Branch is currently developing criteria for formally participating in the  Government of Canada federation. Further information can be obtained by  contacting the Chief Information Officer Branch. </li></ul><h4>Pan-Canadian Standards Development</h4><p>Government organizations are encouraged to become familiar  with standards that enable a pan-Canadian approach. Pan-Canadian standards are currently  being developed by the Identity Management Sub-Committee (IMSC), an  inter-jurisdictional body that reports to the Public Sector Chief Information  Council (PSCIOC) and the Public Sector Service Delivery Council (PSSDC) (also  referred to as the Joint Councils). These councils are supported by the <a href="http://www.iccs-isac.org/">Institute for Citizen-Centred Service</a>. </p><ul><li><em>Pan-Canadian  Identity Validation Standard</em>. This document standardizes identity  information and personal information validation requests and responses between  federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal organizations.</li></ul><h3>Use and Adoption of Other Frameworks, Standards and Guidelines </h3><p>Government organizations are  encouraged to use and adopt other frameworks, standards and guidelines, where  appropriate. Industry and government have adopted the four-level assurance  model in Appendix C of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26776&amp;section=text"><em>Standard on Identity and Credential  Assurance</em></a>, which is illustrated in Table 1. However, there  are a few differences between this model and the other frameworks, standards  and guidelines. When applying related resources, government organizations should  consider the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Adherence  to the four-level assurance model.</strong> Although there are variations in  descriptions and definitions, the four-level assurance model has been accepted  by the global community and is considered normative across the standards and  guidelines. Business requirements, technical standards and agreements need to  adhere to this four-level model.
	</li><li><strong>Separation  of identity and credential assurance. </strong>The Pan-Canadian approach makes an  explicit distinction between identity and credential assurance. Other standards  do not make this distinction; as result, there may be dependencies between  different categories of requirements. In applying other related standards,  government organizations should question whether requirements apply in their  particular context.	</li><li><strong>Formalize  a standards adoption process. </strong>Identity standards and related practices  continue to evolve and change. Government organizations should formalize an  adoption process, taking into account how these standards apply (or do not  apply) in their context. </li></ul><p>It should be noted that the Government  of Canada is currently formalizing a trust framework adoption process that will  approve industry and public sector trust frameworks. The following is a  non-exhaustive list of frameworks, standards and guidelines that may be used:</p><ul><li>The US<em> Federal Identity and Credential Access Management</em> (FICAM) <em>Trust Framework Provider Adoption Process</em> (TFPAP). TFPAP is the mechanism used by the US government to leverage industry-based credentials that citizens already have, for use on government websites.
	</li><li><em>E-Authentication  Guidance for Federal Agencies</em> (OMB M-04-04).This document requires agencies to review new and existing electronic  transactions to ensure that authentication processes provide the appropriate  level of assurance. It establishes and describes four levels of identity  assurance for electronic transactions requiring authentication. </li><li><em>Electronic  Authentication Guideline</em> (NIST SP 800 63-2).This document provides  technical guidelines for US federal agencies implementing electronic  authentication (e-authentication). This guideline supports the implementation  of OMB M-04-04.</li><li><em>Information  Technology – Security Techniques – Entity Authentication Assurance Framework</em> (ISO/IEC 29115:2013).This document provides guidance concerning control  technologies, processes and management activities. It also specifies assurance  criteria that should be used to mitigate authentication threats, communicate  the results of an authentication transaction, and protect personally  identifiable information associated with the authentication process. </li><li><em>Kantara Identity Assurance Framework.</em> This framework comprises a set of documents that includes assurance levels, an assessment scheme and certification requirements for identity-proofing services, and credential strength and credential management services.
	</li><li><em>Requirements  and Implementation Guidelines for Assertion, Evidence and Verification of  Personal Identity</em> (ANSI/NASPO-IDPV-2014). This document is a draft American  National Standard that describes a process, specifies requirements, and  provides implementation guidelines for the assertion, resolution and  verification of personal identity.</li></ul></appendix></appendices><footnotes><footnote anchor="fn1" reference="fn1-rf" title="1"><p>For a definition of identity and other terms used in this guideline, see Appendix A.</p></footnote><footnote anchor="fn2" reference="fn2-rf" title="2"><p>This guideline applies only to individuals.</p></footnote><footnote anchor="fn3" reference="fn3-rf" title="3"><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26776&amp;section=text"><em>Standard on Identity and  Credential Assurance</em></a>, Appendix A</p></footnote><footnote anchor="fn4" reference="fn4-rf" title="4"><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?section=text&amp;id=16577"><em>Directive on Identity Management</em></a>, subsection 3.5.</p></footnote><footnote anchor="fn5" reference="fn5-rf" title="5"><p>Additional controls as required by  applicable legislation, such as <em>the  Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy  Act</em>.</p></footnote><footnote anchor="fn6" reference="fn6-rf" title="6"><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26776&amp;section=text"><em>Standard  on Identity and Credential Assurance</em></a>, Appendix A.</p></footnote><footnote anchor="fn7" reference="fn7-rf" title="7"><p>Identity  validation is also known as identity information validation.
