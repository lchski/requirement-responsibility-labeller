Effective Date"><p>1.1 This Framework takes effect on April 1, 2009. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Objectives"><p>2.1 This Framework for the Management of Compliance:</p><div class="indent1"><p>2.1.1 Clarifies the roles of the Treasury Board, the <a href="#tbportfolio">Treasury Board Portfolio</a>, and that of institutions in monitoring 
and managing compliance with <a href="#legalreq">legal</a> and <a href="#polreq">Treasury Board policy requirements</a>;</p><p>2.1.2 Assists in ensuring that responses to non-compliance are managed appropriately and consistently;</p><p>2.1.3 Facilitates the identification and sharing of approaches to managing compliance;</p><p>2.1.4 Connects learning and development to the management of compliance; and, </p><p>2.1.5 Encourages innovation and informed risk-taking to achieve results.</p></div></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 Excellence in public service management, as summarized in Treasury Board's <a href="/maf-crg/index-eng.asp"><em>Management Accountability Framework</em></a> 
and applicable codes of conduct, is achieved through innovative, ethical and integrated management practices that 
are primarily, but not exclusively set in policies. Public servants understand the importance of public service management 
excellence, and strive to comply with the policies, rules and standards that define and distinguish their decisions and 
actions. Public servants reflect the highest values and ethics in their work to serve Canadians. </p><p>3.2 Managing compliance encompasses making appropriate rules that are known, understood and followed, and for which the 
consequences of non-compliance are clear and commensurate with risk and context. Managing compliance is an area of shared 
responsibility where Treasury Board and government decision-makers have an obligation to ensure that rules are clear and 
coherent, and public servants have an obligation to know and understand the rules and abide by them. </p><p>3.3 A tenet of public sector management holds that the means by which an objective is achieved is as important as the 
objective itself. Legal and Treasury Board policy requirements, including applicable codes of conduct, underpin a minimum 
standard of behaviour and conduct that, in the opinion of legislators and Ministers, is necessary to safeguard the public 
trust. </p><p>3.4 The Framework for the Management of Compliance, along with the "<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13616">Foundation Framework for Treasury Board Policies</a>" 
and the "<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=19422">Risk Management Framework</a>", is one of the key architectural elements of the Treasury Board suite of 
policies. It establishes principles for managing compliance that apply to all instruments in the Treasury Board policy suite. 
These principles are reflected in a suggested set of considerations that <a href="#deputyhead">deputy heads</a> and the Treasury Board Portfolio are 
expected to normally take into account when deciding on the response to non-compliance with legal and Treasury Board policy 
requirements and when advising the Treasury Board.</p><p>3.5 Examples of consequences to non-compliance are also included in the Framework (<a href="#appC">Appendices C</a> and <a href="#appD">D</a>), recognizing that 
decisions on the appropriate response to non-compliance can be both complex and sensitive and therefore must be examined 
on a case by case basis. These examples supplement and provide further specificity to consequences outlined in individual 
Treasury Board policy instruments.</p><p>3.6 The size and complexity of government, and the number and scope of legal and policy requirements, means that immediate, 
full compliance is sometimes a challenge. Treasury Board expects and accepts that institutions and employees will be compliant 
with new Treasury Board policy requirements within reasonable time frames, and that a transition period is necessary for 
new Treasury Board policy requirements. </p><p>3.7 Where it occurs, non-compliance can result from a variety of factors, including: lack of knowledge and training, 
gaps in oversight, inaccurate and incomplete interpretation and application of policies and, in some circumstances, culpable 
misconduct. </p><p>3.8 The management of compliance in government differentiates between non-culpable and culpable behaviour. Honest mistakes 
should be redressed by means intended to realign behaviour and improve performance within expected norms and objectives 
while culpable behaviour is not tolerated and corrective measures, including disciplinary actions where merited, will be 
taken.</p><p>3.9 A robust compliance management approach identifies the best methods (including training and education) to align behaviour 
with expectations. It supports innovation and creativity, and provides feedback for continuing reassessment, refinement 
and development of legal and Treasury Board policy requirements.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Definitions"><p>4.1 Definitions used in the interpretation of this framework are provided in <a href="#appA">Appendix A</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Relationship to Other Treasury Board Frameworks"><p>5.1 The Framework for the Management of Compliance supports the <em>Management Accountability Framework</em> and complements 
the "Foundation Framework for Treasury Board Policies", specifically sub-section 5.4 focusing on oversight and consequences, 
and provides the basis for managing compliance to which other Treasury Board frameworks and mandatory policy instruments 
align. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Scope"><p>6.1 The Framework for the Management of Compliance is systemic in scope and applies to legal and Treasury Board policy 
requirements. </p><p>6.2 While not designed to alter or add particular consequences to specific situations of non-compliance, the Framework 
serves as a statement of intent that implicates institutions and the individuals who represent them. The Framework assumes 
that all individuals to whom legal or Treasury Board policy requirements apply, are collectively responsible for compliance 
with those requirements.</p><p>6.3 In their capacity as Accounting Officers, deputy heads need to be cognizant of all applicable legal and policy requirements 
incumbent upon their institutions above and beyond those requirements falling within the ambit of this Framework. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Principles"><p>7.1 The effective management of compliance hinges upon having informed management and employees throughout the various 
levels of an institution. It is also dependent on the ability of management to integrate the spirit and intent of policies 
within management culture and its overall plan to achieve management excellence against expectations set out in the <em>
Management Accountability Framework</em>. In particular, the Framework is based on the following principles or prerequisites 
which seek to maximize compliance:</p><div class="indent1"><p>7.1.1 Legal and Treasury Board policy requirements are clear, coherent and reflective of a risk-based approach to managing 
compliance;</p><p>7.1.2 Legal and Treasury Board policy requirements are integrated into the approval processes, procedures and control 
systems of institutions;</p><p>7.1.3 All individuals in the institution are informed of legal and Treasury Board policy requirements that relate to 
their areas of decision-making. They are knowledgeable and have access to relevant information in order to make decisions 
that are reflective of legal and Treasury Board policy requirements. They understand these requirements thus facilitating 
or enabling consensus and consent on the need for compliance;</p><p>7.1.4 Compliance with legal requirements and Treasury Board policy is monitored, with the focus of monitoring determined 
on the basis of risk;</p><p>7.1.5 Potential situations of non-compliance are examined; and,</p><p>7.1.6 Actual situations of non-compliance are met with appropriate responses.</p></div></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="8. Core Responsibilities in Managing Compliance"><p>8.1 <a href="#deputyhead">Deputy heads</a> are responsible for, amongst other things:</p><div class="indent1"><p>8.1.1 Embodying public service values and ethics and fostering an organizational culture reflective of the values contained 
in Treasury Board's applicable codes of conduct;</p><p>8.1.2 Ensuring compliance with legal and Treasury Board policy requirements within their institutions while fostering 
an organizational environment conducive to innovation and informed risk-taking to deliver better value to Canadians; </p><p>8.1.3 Ensuring fair, consistent, and transparent application of labour relations practices within their institutions;</p><p>8.1.4 Ensuring that employees are properly trained and have access to learning opportunities and relevant information 
to increase their awareness and knowledge of applicable legal and Treasury Board policy requirements;</p><p>8.1.5 As part of good people management, ensuring that performance management is aligned with government priorities and 
business plans including compliance considerations. Deputy heads should refer to the performance management policies and 
associated directives and guidelines for the tools that are available to them to address performance management issues;
</p><p>8.1.6 Establishing a robust environment of internal controls and sound management practices that are transparent, understood 
and supported in the institution;</p><p>8.1.7 Monitoring internal management practices and, where issues arise, taking action to maintain a robust environment 
of internal control; </p><p>8.1.8 Taking appropriate corrective action necessary to restore compliance; and,</p><p>8.1.9 Advising the Secretary of the Treasury Board of any knowledge or reason to believe that significant non-compliance 
with a legal or Treasury Board policy requirement has occurred that could undermine or negatively impact the institution 
or the government.</p></div><p>8.2 The <a href="#tbportfolio">Treasury Board Portfolio</a> is responsible for: </p><div class="indent1"><p>8.2.1 Appraising the state of compliance with legal and Treasury Board policy requirements across government and taking 
appropriate action as necessary to align behaviour with these requirements. In doing so the Treasury Board Portfolio will 
use information derived from various sources listed in section 10.1;</p><p>8.2.2 Ensuring that Treasury Board policy instruments are clear, coherent and reflective of due considerations of risk;</p><p>8.2.3 Developing approaches to training and education that are intended to increase awareness and knowledge of legal 
and Treasury Board policy requirements;</p><p>8.2.4 Identifying and sharing examples of effective practices to promote improvements and consistency in compliance management 
across government; and, </p><p>8.2.5 Formulating advice to Treasury Board in respect of any additional follow-up that may be necessary in order to ensure 
a comprehensive response to situations involving non-compliance.</p></div><p>8.3 Managers and employees are responsible for taking the necessary steps to keep themselves informed of legal and Treasury 
Board policy requirements that relate to their areas of decision-making and availing themselves of training and educational 
opportunities.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="9" title="9. Responding to Non-Compliance"><p><strong>Deputy heads</strong></p><p>9.1 Deputy heads, when responding to non-compliance, need to ensure that the nature of the consequences and their severity 
are commensurate with the nature of the non-compliance. The full response may be composed of several different consequences 
that could include elements of learning and development, performance, discipline, reporting of suspected offences to the 
responsible law-enforcement agency, institutional actions, and specific consequences that may be outlined in legal requirements, 
applicable codes of conduct, and individual Treasury Board policy instruments. </p><p>9.2 In considering the possible mix of consequences, a deputy head needs to balance various considerations including 
the following:</p><div class="indent1"><p>9.2.1 What is the impact? This includes consideration of the seriousness of harm or potential harm, such as the impact 
on resources, the workforce,reputation of government, and assets including loss, waste and misallocation of funds, or whether 
there was personal gain;</p><p>9.2.2 Is there a history of non-compliance? The compliance history should be considered including previous cases and 
seriousness of non-compliance, as well as whether the non-compliance is isolated to one individual or organizational unit 
within the institution or reflective of a systemic problem;</p><p>9.2.3 Was there intent? Was the behaviour culpable or non-culpable? Consideration should be given as to whether there 
was knowing and deliberate contravention of legal or policy requirements; and,</p><p>9.2.4 Are there other circumstances? Consideration should be given to whether, in instances of non-compliance, the public 
good, including the interest of taxpayers, was ultimately served or harmed.</p></div><p>9.3 For specific requirements and guidance on: </p><div class="indent1"><p>9.3.1 <strong>Learning and Development:</strong> Deputy heads should refer to the "<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12405">Policy on Learning Development and 
Training</a>" and associated directives and guidelines, with particular focus on knowledge standards and required training;
</p><p>9.3.2 <strong>Institutional actions:</strong> To address matters internal to the institution, such as management structures 
and control systems, deputy heads should refer to the relevant Treasury Board policies when developing a response. In addition, 
deputy heads may wish to consult with the Treasury Board Portfolio in formulating options;</p><p>9.3.3 <strong>Discipline, the taking of administrative action, or in situations where the presence of the employee or 
employees at work could undermine or impede the investigation:</strong> Deputy heads should refer to the Policy on Labour 
Relations and associated guidelines (e.g., <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12596">Guidelines for Discipline</a>, <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12608">
Guidelines for Demotion/Termination of Employment</a> for other reasons). These instruments set out a range of possible administrative and disciplinary 
measures that are reflective of a graduated, progressive scale to allow for the tailoring of an action appropriate to a given situation; and,</p><p>9.3.4 <strong>The actions to be taken if criminal activity is suspected:</strong> Deputy heads should refer to the
<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578"><em>Government Security Policy</em></a> and associated directives.</p></div><p>9.4 In addition to determining the level and type of consequence that may be warranted, deputy heads should also examine 
how the non-compliance came to light in order to assess the adequacy of internal control systems and whether there are any 
management performance issues that need to be addressed within the institution.</p><p><strong>Treasury Board Portfolio</strong></p><p>9.5 The Treasury Board Portfolio, when responding to situations of significant non-compliance, should use the series 
of questions set out in section 9.2 of this Framework, along with the following additional questions, to assess the adequacy 
of the deputy head's response and to determine whether any consequences should be considered by the Treasury Board: </p><div class="indent1"><p>9.5.1 Has compliance been restored? Consideration should be given to the actions taken to restore compliance and if compliance 
has not been restored that the risks to the government are properly mitigated; </p><p>9.5.2 What steps has the deputy head taken to mitigate the risks of a recurrence? Is the likelihood of a recurrence high 
and, if so, what are the risks to the government in the event of a recurrence; and,</p><p>9.5.3 What is the institution's general level of management performance? Consideration should be given to whether there 
is evidence of a potential systemic problem within the institution or whether the non-compliance is an isolated incident. 
Consideration will also be given as to whether, as a whole, the institution either has a positive record in the performance 
of its management functions or it has made satisfactory progress in improving its management functions.</p></div><p>9.6 The consequences applied by the Treasury Board and its Portfolio are undertaken with a view to supporting the deputy 
head in restoring compliance within the institution or to mitigate the risks and associated costs of control failure, mismanagement 
or wrongdoing until controls and compliance are restored.</p><p>9.7 If insufficient information is available to answer these questions, the Treasury Board Portfolio may require that 
the deputy head commence a review process, such as by way of an audit, in accordance with the scope determined by the Portfolio 
or the Portfolio may commence its own review process of the matter, refer the matter to the Office of the Auditor General, 
or if criminal behaviour is suspected, refer the matter to the appropriate body for criminal investigation.</p><p><strong>Deputy heads and Treasury Board Portfolio</strong></p><p>9.8 Additional criteria that may be taken into consideration by a deputy head or the Treasury Board Portfolio are listed 
at <a href="#appB">Appendix B</a>, including, where practicable, consideration of any underlying causes. While not exhaustive, deputy heads 
and the Treasury Board Portfolio may also refer to <a href="#appC">Appendix C</a> for examples of institutional consequences and to <a href="#appD">Appendix 
D</a> for examples of administrative and disciplinary action with regard to individuals.</p><p>9.9 These criteria will help deputy heads and the Treasury Board and its Portfolio to determine the most appropriate 
response to restore compliance, what consequences if any should be applied, and how to mitigate the risks of a recurrence.
</p><p><strong>Consequences</strong></p><p>9.10 In order to foster knowledge, acceptance, ability and effective compliance with legal and Treasury Board policy 
requirements, consequences, that are clear and commensurate with risk and context of a given situation, should be employed.
</p><p>9.11 Possible consequences range from persuasion (e.g. maintaining a dialogue) to restraint (e.g. reorganization of an institution 
or termination of employment). Consequences can be applied internally or externally, and involve officials, deputy heads 
and, in more significant cases, the Treasury Board and responsible Ministers. </p><p>9.12 The following sets out the range of consequences to which deputy heads and the Treasury Board Portfolio should refer 
in determining or recommending responses to address non-compliance. </p><p><em><strong>Persuasion</strong></em></p><p>Engaging in discussions aimed at aligning or realigning behaviour with legal and policy requirements in response to potential 
or actual low impact situations of non-compliance. Discussions can take place at a variety of levels amongst officials. 
This process is largely informal although there may be a need for increased monitoring through vehicles such as the <em>
Management Accountability Framework</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Consent</strong></em></p><p>Occurs where persuasion has resulted in an agreed-to course of action that needs to be made transparent, requires formal 
commitment and documentation of follow-up and resolution. </p><p>The level of commitment may be detailed in letters at the officials' level that could include the deputy head. In some 
cases, Treasury Board consideration of the proposed measures may be sought.</p><p>Persuasion and consent differ in terms of the level of formality of the process but both are characterized by cooperation 
between parties.</p><p><em><strong>Counteraction</strong></em></p><p>Recourse is needed to impose remedial or corrective actions when more collaborative approaches have failed and when consequences 
of non-compliance need to be demonstrated. Consequences encompass a range of interventions - imposing or denying certain 
actions or privileges - that would compel the undertaking of prescribed activities. </p><p>Implicit in this approach is the absence of demonstrated responsibility for ensuring policy compliance, or persistent 
failures in control functions.</p><p><em><strong>Restraint</strong></em></p><p>Restraining institutions or individuals involves the curtailment or removal of authority or responsibility to such an 
extent that they are unable to perform certain actions. Institutions can be restrained from continuing in their current 
state, for example, where Treasury Board suspends operations pending corrective reorganization.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="10" title="10. Monitoring and Reporting "><p>10.1 The Treasury Board Portfolio will use information gathered through a range of sources that include: reporting on 
compliance under this Framework and renewed Treasury Board policies, <em>Management Accountability Framework</em> assessments, 
internal and horizontal audits, Auditor General reports, evaluations, Treasury Board submissions, and other reports to Parliament 
to gauge the state of compliance management in the government.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="11" title="11.
