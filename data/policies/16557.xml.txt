        As you come to appreciate your contribution to the management of government  information, discuss with your manager any ideas or issues you may have. Then,  as needed, consult any one of the various IM specialists or experts who can  help you learn about the practices and procedures that apply to your  organization.</p><p>
        These guidelines are designed for all Government of Canada employees and  are relevant to a wide variety of environments. Institutions are encouraged to  use these guidelines as a base that can be added to and customized to reflect  institutional policies, procedures, directives, guidelines, tools, and best  practices.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>For the purposes of this document, the term "Government of Canada  employees" includes employees of federal institutions as defined in  Schedule 2 of the <em>Financial  Administration Act</em>. The advice contained in this  guideline, however, could be beneficial to employees of institutions outside of  this definition.</li><li>For the purposes of this guideline, "information" is equivalent  to "information resource(s)" and these are the broadest of all terms  - including any documentary material produced both in published and unpublished  form regardless of communications source, information format, production mode  or recording medium. The term "information resource" is introduced  through the <em>Directive on Recordkeeping</em>.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="The Value of Managing Information"><section anchor="3.1" title="Part of our  daily work"><p>Employees have a  duty to document their decisions and activities.  Recognizing the value of  information and managing it well is pivotal to our success, both as individuals  and as an organization.</p><p>
          Every day, we create, collect, use and share information resources that  provide evidence of our business activities. These information resources help  us to make informed decisions that support our managers, our peers, and our  clients and ultimately provide results for Canadians. Information resources come in many  different published and unpublished forms and must be managed regardless of  communications source, information format, production mode or recording medium.  Information resources include textual records (memos, reports, invoices,  contracts, etc.), electronic records (e-mails, databases, web pages, data,  etc.), communication media (telephone conversations, instant messages, wikis,  blogs, podcasts, etc.), publications (reports, books, magazines), films, sound  recordings, photographs, documentary art, graphics, maps, and artefacts. By properly managing information, we demonstrate that we understand our  responsibility to both our colleagues and to Canadians and that we take this  responsibility seriously.</p><p>
          But what does it mean to manage information resources properly?</p><p>
          This guide is designed to help you gain a basic understanding of  information and records management concepts and show you how you can start  applying them today. As these concepts begin to shape the way you work with  information, you'll quickly discover both immediate and long-term benefits.</p></section><section anchor="3.2" title="Managing information - Who is  responsible?"><h4>We're all responsible </h4><p>Because we all create, collect, use, and share information resources as  part of our day-to-day work, we are all responsible for effectively managing  those information resources while they are under our control.</p><p>
          As per the <em>Policy on Information Management</em> and  related policy instruments, employees of the Government of  Canada (GC) must do the following:</p><ul><li>document business activities and decisions;</li><li>comply with institutional information management (IM)  policies, directives, and standards, using approved tools, systems, and  procedures;</li><li>organize, file, and store information resources within the  corporate repository, ensuring easy access when needed to make decisions, and  to support program and service delivery;</li><li>share and reuse information resources to support  collaboration and facilitate business operations, respecting all legal and  policy requirements;</li><li>protect sensitive information, providing or restricting  its access in accordance with law, regulation, and policy;</li><li>be informed of and apply retention periods for  information resources;</li><li>protect and preserve information resources of business  value critical to business resumption; and</li><li>comply with the requirements of policies on official  languages and privacy.</li></ul><p>Your IM specialists are available to help you with these responsibilities,  as needed.</p></section><section anchor="3.3" title="Key principles for managing information  in all media"><h4>The same principles apply to paper and electronic information </h4><p>Support your business by applying these principles to the way you manage  information resources. These principles promote the efficient use of institutional  resources, make information easier to find in the future, and ensure its  protection and preservation-all in accordance with business, legal, and policy  requirements.</p><ul><li>Create or acquire information resources that support  programs, services, and ongoing operations.</li><li>Capture those information resources of business value by  saving them within the corporate repository.</li><li>Avoid collecting duplicate information resources.</li><li>Share and reuse information resources, respecting legal  restrictions.</li><li>Ensure that information resources of business value are  complete, accurate, current, relevant, and understandable.</li><li>Support information access and retrieval, respecting  privacy, policy, and legal requirements.</li><li>Safeguard information resources of business value against  unlawful access, loss, and damage.</li><li>Ensure information resources of enduring business value  are properly preserved.</li></ul><p>The following sections of this guide offer simple and practical guidelines  for applying these principles to both paper and electronic information. These  guidelines help you to standardize the information management and recordkeeping  techniques you already use on a regular basis, thereby saving you time right  now and in the future when you have a need to find and access information.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Managing Information - In Practice"><p>Throughout its life, information will need to be managed in different ways.  The following is an overview of some of the practices recommended for you to  apply to all information while it's in your care and control. While this  guideline has been developed to be as complete as possible for a general  audience, there may be additional practices and procedures in place in your  institution, so we encourage you to consult your manager and IM specialists, as  needed.</p><p>
        If you make a habit of applying these practices along with those specific  to your institution, you will see a difference in the way you work. The  information you need will be at your fingertips and it will be easy to share  with your colleagues and managers. This alone can have a dramatic effect on the  quality of your work life and the success of your organization.</p><section anchor="4.1" title="Plan for your information needs"><p>Think about the  information you and your colleagues will need to accomplish your objectives and  to make sound decisions. For example, ask yourself questions such as the  following:</p><ul><li>What type of information will I need to support my work requirements, and  who will need to access it?</li><li>Will I need published information resources (e.g. books, magazines,  databases, subscriptions, and online resources)? Do they already exist  elsewhere, and can I use these resources to reduce duplication and costs?</li><li>What volume of information will I need to manage on a regular basis?</li><li>Will any information require security classification? If so, at what  levels?</li><li>Has a Privacy Impact Assessment been performed, or is it needed to address  any privacy issues?</li></ul><p>The answers to these questions can be used in developing a sound IM plan.  Discuss these questions with your manager and then consult your IM specialists  for further assistance.</p><p>
          For more information, see the section on “<a href="#cha8">Where You Can Find More Help</a>".</p></section><section anchor="4.2" title="Create and collect information"><p>As you create and  collect information, identify its value to your institution and manage it  accordingly, making sure that it's accessible to those who need it. Some  recommended practices are listed below:</p><ul><li>Whenever possible, use electronic systems to create, collect, use, and  manage information resources.</li><li>Follow institutional naming conventions when identifying, filing, and storing  information resources.</li><li>File or save information resources in a corporate repository (e.g. electronic records  management system).</li><li>Do not  forget to include email and instant messages of business value when saving  information resources into the corporate repository.  These should not be stored on your mobile  device or in your email account as these locations do not meet the requirements  for sharing, using, safeguarding and storing information resources of business  value.</li><li>Preserve the integrity and value of information resources of business value  by keeping the structure, context, and content intact to facilitate  future searching and use.</li><li>Respect information security and privacy requirements.</li><li>Respect official languages policies and guidelines.</li></ul><h4>Structure, context, and content</h4><p>An information  resource's structure (format and links to other  documents or attachments), its context (information  about the sender, recipient or recipients, and the time and date of creation),  and its content (identified in the subject  line) represent key metadata elements-often referred to as "profile  fields"- that preserve the value of the information resource in any  medium, provided the elements remain intact. Failing to complete this information  or removing or separating the associations of any one of these elements from an  information resource compromises its authenticity, usefulness, and reliability.</p><p>
          Speak to your IM  specialists to obtain more detailed advice on how you can put these practices  to work in your own organization.</p></section><section anchor="4.3" title="Organize your information"><p>It is recommended  that you organize your information in a logical and systematic way so that it's  easy to find and share. Where possible, use standards, rules, and procedures  established or adopted by your institution. For example:</p><ul><li>Organize all information resources according to your institution's  classification system or taxonomies.</li><li>Organize all published material according to the classification system of  your institution's library.</li></ul><p>Information that  is well organized will help you to work better and also supports your need to  respond efficiently and effectively to requests regarding access to  information, privacy, and legal discovery. Classification systems are designed  to manage information resources according to their business value, ensuring  their proper retention and disposition.</p><p>
          For more  information, see the "<a href=" #cha5">Manage  Information Based on its Value</a>" section.</p><p>
          The system you  use to manage the information you work with will depend on the standards and  tools available in your institution. Consult your IM specialists for more  information or advice.</p></section><section anchor="4.4" title="Reuse and share information"><p>Once you have organized your information resources, you will be able to  quickly find and reuse them to make work life easier for you and others. While  using and sharing information, please consider the following business rules:</p><ul><li>Comply with privacy, security, and legal restrictions.</li><li>Whenever possible, use electronic media to share  information resources (business systems, email, shared drives, corporate repositories,  websites, and so on).</li><li>Ensure that information remains complete, accurate,  current, relevant, and understandable.</li><li>Verify the accuracy and reliability of information,  especially when conducting Web-related research.</li><li>Implement version control protocols when editing  electronic documents.</li><li>Take advantage of institutional investments in  information resources (magazine and journal subscriptions, databases, content  management systems, online library services, and so on), while respecting  copyright, licensing, and intellectual property rights.</li><li>When retaining information that has been copied, indicate  the source (and locator information), whether it is from an information  resource already saved in a corporate repository, from a publication, or from a  website.</li></ul><p>Managing information to the way you work has many advantages. It saves you  time and enables you to share information with others, reducing the duplication  of effort and improving service delivery.</p><p>
          If you notice ways that these practices can help your organization to be  more effective, communicate them to your manager. As always, your IM  specialists are available to provide you with the advice you need.</p></section><section anchor="4.5" title="Maintain and protect information"><p>While protecting  information includes guarding against unauthorized access, disclosure, or  destruction, it also involves preserving the integrity and authenticity of the  information. To accomplish this it is recommended that you do the following:</p><ul><li>Store all information in a manner that preserves its form and status,  keeping its structure, context, and content intact.</li><li>Protect information against loss, damage, unauthorized access, alteration,  or destruction. This includes informing contractors of their responsibility to  protect information that has been entrusted to them.</li><li>Mark each information resource according to its proper security  classification, either on the paper document or in the appropriate metadata field  in the electronic document profile. Avoid applying a label at higher or lower  security level than it deserves.</li><li>Protect classified and protected information by ensuring it isn't left in  waste or recycle containers and by storing it in locked desks or cabinets after  work hours and during extended periods of absence.</li><li>Store classified information in approved locked cabinets. Only store it on  open shelves if the room has been constructed according to the Secure Room  "B" standards of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</li><li>Avoid sending or storing any information above the security level for which  your institutional network has been rated (normally Protected A or B).</li><li>Avoid populating fields or subject lines with personal information or with  words that imply the disclosure of personal details or legal or disciplinary  actions against an individual, unless this relates to your main line of  business (i.e. security).</li><li>Implement effective access control procedures, ensuring that classified and  protected information is only made available on a need-to-know basis to those  who are authorized to access it. A security clearance does not automatically  provide someone the right to see all information.</li></ul><p>By taking these  steps, we not only ensure access to the most reliable information today; we  also preserve the value of information for future generations of Canadians.</p><p>
          All government information resources require some level of protection.  There is a particular need, however, to properly mark and adequately protect  and secure classified and protected information, in all media, as its  compromise could bring injury to individuals or to the national interest as a  whole.</p><p>
          If you notice areas that need improvement or think you need more help,  speak to your manager. Then, contact your IM specialists, your security office  representatives, or both to help you implement these practices.</p><p>
          For more  information, refer to the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16579"><em>Directive on Departmental Security Management</em></a>. In  addition, consult your organization's security manual to confirm the specific  procedures that apply within your work environment, or contact your security  office representative.</p></section><section anchor="4.6" title="Transfer or destroy the right  information at the right time"><p>Not all  information has the same value. While some will need to be kept long-term to  support your institution's operational needs or to preserve information of  enduring value, other information can be disposed of when it has outlived its  usefulness.</p><p>
          To ensure that  you are always working with relevant and reliable information, it is  recommended you do the following:</p><ul><li>regularly destroy transitory  records as soon as they are no longer  needed, complying with your institution's IM and security procedures; and</li><li>cooperate with IM specialists to properly transfer digital or paper copies  of information resources of business value through the Library and Archives  Canada (LAC) regulations and disposition authorities.</li></ul><p>Applying these practices  will make it much easier to quickly access the information you really need and  will help to reduce storage and maintenance costs. However, please follow the  guidelines of your institution, the GC, or both, as strict rules govern the  disposal of government information.</p><p>For more  information, see the section "<a href=" #cha5">Manage  Information Based on Its Value</a>".</p><p>
          If you see the  need to dispose of information in your area, speak to your manager and consult  with the appropriate IM specialist (e.g. the records or library IM specialist).  For more information, see the "<a href=" #cha8">Where You Can Find More Help</a>" section.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Manage Information Based on Its Value"><p>Generally, as you  go about your normal business activities each day, you generate and collect  paper and electronic information resources. These information resources provide  an important record of the actions you've taken, the decisions you've made, and  the reasons for both, allowing for transparency and accountability.</p><p>Because of their value, it is vital that you ensure  that such information resources exist for all of your business activities and decisions, whether  they are generated naturally in the execution of a business process or  specifically created to document that process. This requirement comes from the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12754"><em>Directive on  Information Management Roles and Responsibilities</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>In order to  ensure the ongoing value of these information resources of business value,  capture them along with any relevant metadata (e.g. subject, author, transmittal  data) to ensure that they are complete, authentic, and reliable. Retain  information resources of business value in accordance with institutional  records management standards and procedures, stored or profiled within a corporate  repository, if available, and protected against damage and loss.</p><p>For more  information, see the section on "<a href=" #cha4">Managing  Information - In Practice</a>." Your IM specialists can also provide extensive  advice and support.</p><section anchor="5.1" title="Document your business activities and  decisions"><p>The following are  examples of the types of information resources that are of business value and  which you might create, acquire or collect to document business functions and  activities:</p><ul><li>transactions – orders, receipts,  requests, confirmations;</li><li>interactions between clients, vendors, partners;</li><li>planning documents – budgets, forecasts,  work plans, blueprints (technical or engineering designs), information  architecture schematics;</li><li>reports, policy, briefing notes, memoranda, or other papers supporting  business activities – all significant  versions (those that were circulated for comment or that contain comments  related to the substance of the content and provide evidence of the document's  evolution), the final product, distribution information;</li><li>meeting documents – agendas, official  minutes, records of decision;</li><li>records of contact with lobbyists (This supports the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-12.4/"><em>Lobbying Act</em></a> that requires designated public  office-holders to retain information about contact with lobbyists);</li><li>committee documents – terms of reference,  list of members;</li><li>form letters or templates used to collect responses, related instructions,  completed responses in any format;</li><li>client records – applications, evaluations,  emails, assessments;</li><li>records of discussions, deliberations, or any situation related to any of  the above that further documents the decisions made along with the logic used;  and,</li><li>information resources which could provide additional information for auditing  and monitoring activities and programs.</li></ul></section><section anchor="5.2" title="Keep information only for as long as it  is needed, then transfer or destroy it"><p>The value of  information doesn't only determine how it's used and protected but also when  and how you can dispose of it. Many factors, including laws, regulations and  information policies, and business needs affect how long information should be  kept and what its ultimate outcome will be,  e.g. in compliance with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>, personal information must be kept for two years after the last  administrative use, unless the individual consents to earlier disposal.  Information resources of enduring value will be  transferred to LAC. Still other information, such as transitory records, might  only be needed for a very short period of time and can then be destroyed.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Transitory records</strong> are those information  resources that are required only for a limited time to ensure the completion of  a routine action or the preparation of a subsequent record. They do not include  records required by government institutions or Ministers to control, support,  or document the delivery of programs, to carry out operations, to make  decisions, or to account for activities of government.</p><p>– Source : <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/government-information-resources/disposition/multi-institutional-disposition-authorities/Pages/1990-transitory-records.aspx">Multi-Institutional Disposition Authorities - Authority for the Destruction of Transitory Records</a></p></blockquote><p>Examples of  transitory information resources include the following:</p><ul><li>working drafts of no particular significance that were never formally  circulated;</li><li>annotated drafts where annotations become part of a subsequent version and  do not provide evidence of decisions related to the evolution of the final  document;</li><li>a copy of a document kept for ease of reference or convenience only;</li><li>information that lacks logical or coherent organization and therefore does  not have context; and</li><li>data that has been used for an update process (including batch processing)  and that is no longer needed to serve as backup or to support reconstruction of  the master file or database.</li></ul><p>Other information that  should be deleted when no longer required:</p><ul><li>casual communications such as invitations to lunch; and</li><li>personal documents stored on your computer or in your work area.</li></ul><p>LAC authorizes  the destruction of transitory records when they are no longer required for  business purposes. You should consult, however, with your manager and IM  specialists to know if there are specific institutional rules in place that  provides guidance for transitory records.</p><h4>Caution!</h4><p>Transitory records, like all other  information resources under the care and control of the institution are subject  to Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) legislation.</p><p>An exact copy of any information resources  relevant to an ATIP request is made and retained for two years after the last administrative action by the ATIP office  for the purpose of responding to an access or privacy request. This does not,  however, remove the IM requirements of the original. Once the ATIP office has received  an exact and complete copy of all information resources responsive to a request  under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/index.html"><em>Access to  Information Act</em></a> or <em><a href="http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/">Privacy Act</a></em>, the information resource may continue to be managed  according to its normal life cycle. The same applies to information resources that have to be retained  during any legal discovery process relating to the subject of the information  resources.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Your personal documents are not  under control of the institution and are not subject to ATIP legislation or  legal discovery processes. (Examples of personal documents include records  accumulated before assuming a federal government position; materials pertaining  to an individual's private affairs outside government services; and diaries,  journals, or other personal notes prepared for other reasons than carrying on  the work of the institution). If, however, you used personal removable devices  to transport business related information resources, those information  resources on the devices are subject to ATIP or legal discovery processes.  Similarly, if you copy or create information resources on your home computer or  other personal devices, these information resources are deemed to be under the  care and control of the institution and are subject to the acts.</p><h4>Storage of inactive information  resources of business value</h4><p>When information  resources have not been consulted for an extended period of time, they are  considered inactive. However, they may not yet have reached the end of their retention  period.  When this happens, inactive information resources of business value are  sometimes transferred to more economical off-site storage facilities until the  time comes to finally dispose of them, either by destroying them or  transferring them to LAC. While they are in storage, you will still be able to  access these information resources, whether for business purposes or to respond  to ATIP or legal discovery requests. If you need to arrange for the storage of  your inactive information resources, speak to your manager and to your institutional  IM specialists.</p><p>The retention period is the period of time that information resources should  be kept before they can be legally disposed. This period is as follows:</p><ul><li>established by the business managers in consultation with IM specialists;</li><li>counted from the last administrative action performed on or using the  information resource; and</li><li>usually identified in years.</li></ul><p>For example,  financial records usually have a retention period that ends six fiscal years  after the last administrative use.</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="Penalties for unauthorized destruction"><p>Legislation  stipulates that government information resources must be protected against  unauthorized destruction.</p><p>
          The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/index.html"><em>Access to  Information Act</em></a> criminalizes the intent to deny a right of access through destruction,  mutilation, alteration, falsification, or concealment of a government record as  well as directing or counseling an individual to do those things. Individuals  who are found guilty could face criminal charges, financial penalties, or both.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Managing Electronic Information"><p>As more and more  information is created and transmitted electronically, it's important to  recognize that both electronic and paper-based information resources should be  managed according to sound information management principles. Identify,  capture, retain, protect, and preserve electronic information (including instant  messages, email, and attachments) so that it continues to be available and  accessible to support decision-making as well as program and service delivery.</p><p>
        Because  electronic information is so easy to create and delete, managing it effectively  becomes an issue of personal accountability. File current or frequently  referenced information in a way that permits efficient and authorized access,  while also disposing of transitory information as soon as it’s no longer  needed.</p><p>
        For more  information, see the "<a href=" #cha5">Manage  Information Based on Its Value</a>" section.</p><section anchor="6.1" title="Managing information on shared drives"><p>Where there are no established procedures in an institution to manage  electronic information or if you have electronic information resources that  cannot be managed using the established procedures, your organization's shared  drive can be used to store your electronic information resources. It is  recommended that you have procedures in place to properly manage it. Name,  inventory, and organize the electronic documents according to, or linking to,  the institutional classification system if one is in place. Associating  electronically stored information with the institutional classification  structure facilitates locating and retrieving related information and applying  life-cycle management procedures, including planned transfer or deletion. Keep  in mind, however, that access to classified and protected material is  restricted to authorized employees. Also, when using a shared drive, it is  advised that file permissions are set to "read only" to ensure  documents are not altered or easily destroyed.</p><p>
          If you don't have an institutional classification structure, your IM  specialists can suggest effective alternate methods for organizing your shared  drive.</p></section><section anchor="6.2" title="Filing electronic information"><p>The method you  use to file information will depend on the policies, procedures, and tools  available in your organization. Many institutions have deployed an Electronic Document and Record Management System (EDRMS) such as GCDOCS or Records, Document and Information Management System (RDIMS) or a comparable  electronic business system to capture these information resources. In most  cases, these types of systems allow electronic documents, email messages and  attachments, and digital images to be filed directly into a corporate repository  according to an institutional classification structure. Once filed, they are  managed according to established IM and recordkeeping policies, standards, and  rules, ensuring their proper retention and disposition. Anyone with authorized  access can search for and retrieve these information resources when they're  needed.</p><p>If your  organization doesn't have an electronic records and document management system  speak to your manager and consult with the appropriate specialist (e.g. the  records or library functional specialist) to find out more about your internal  policies on filing electronic information. For more information, see the "<a href=" #cha8">Where You Can Find More Help</a>" section.</p></section><section anchor="6.3" title="What about email messages?"><h4>Emails and instant messages can also be of business value </h4><p>Email messages  that document decisions or actions pertaining to GC business are considered information resources of business value which  are to be retained and managed accordingly, along with any attachments or  metadata that contribute to their structure,  context, and content. The same applies to instant messages, such as  pin-to-pin, Blackberry Messenger, text messages, desktop chat, etc.  For more information, see the section on  "<a href="#sec6.2">Filing electronic information</a>." </p><p>
          Generally, the  originator of an email or instant message will be responsible for retaining and  filing the message (along with attachments). Sometimes, however, emails or  instant messages will be received from private citizens or from people in other  government institutions who don't have access to the institutional filing  system. In these cases, the receiver usually has the responsibility for properly  storing and retaining the message.  Seek  advice from your manager or IM specialists about who has the responsibility to  retain and file the message.</p><h4>File your email and instant messages</h4><p>Properly file  email messages and instant messages. Information of business value must be  stored in the institution’s corporate repository.  It should not be stored indefinitely in your  email application or on your hard drive as these do not meet the requirements  for storing, safeguarding, sharing and protecting government information  resources of business value. Nor should you simply rely on backup processes to  store your email records. Information stored in backups is not identified,  organized, or inventoried to facilitate access and retrieval or timely disposition.  Additionally, there is no mechanism to ensure the information is current,  relevant, or accurate, and you have no control over how long the backup is  retained. The volume and random nature of information in backups makes  retrieval laborious and imprecise.
