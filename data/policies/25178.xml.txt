   federal public administration named in Schedule IV of the Financial Administration Act, its chief executive officer or, if there is no chief executive officer, 
   its statutory deputy head or, if there is neither, the person who occupies the position designated by the Governor in Council in respect of that portion.<br />For 
   the purposes of this policy the term “deputy head” means deputy heads or their delegated alternates.</dd><dt><strong>public servant:</strong></dt><dd>a person employed in organizations defined in section 2 of this policy. This includes indeterminate and term employees, employees on leave without pay, students 
   participating in Student Employment Programs, casual, seasonal and part-time workers.<br />Although they are not public servants, individuals on incoming Interchange 
   Canada assignments are expected to comply with, and volunteers are expected to respect, the requirements in Appendix B of this policy. Order-in-council appointees, 
   such as deputy heads, are subject to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36.65/">Conflict of Interest Act</a></em>, and are not subject to this

   or in which the public servant uses his or her office for personal gain. A <em>real</em> conflict of interest exists at the present time, an <em>apparent</em> conflict

   official duties, such as an appointment to a board of directors, or other outside function.</dd></dl></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B: Requirements for public servants to prevent and deal with conflict of interest and post-employment situations"><p>Following are the conflict of interest and post-employment requirements that are a condition of employment for public servants in all organizations subject to this policy. These requirements are grounded in and serve to uphold the values contained in the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em>. By upholding these ethical standards, public servants conserve and enhance public confidence in the honesty, fairness and integrity of the public service. These requirements also form part of Canada’s commitments as a signatory to <a href="http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/crime/corruption.aspx?lang=eng&amp;view=d">international agreements on values and ethics</a>.</p><section anchor="B.1" title="Prevention of conflict of interest"><p>A public servant maintains public confidence in the objectivity of the public service by preventing and avoiding situations that could give the appearance of a conflict of interest, result in a potential for a conflict of interest or result in an actual conflict of interest. Conflict of interest does not relate exclusively to matters concerning financial transactions and the transfer of economic benefit. While financial activity is important, conflicts of interest in any area of activity can have a negative impact on the perceived objectivity of the public service. With the permanent and pervasive nature of information technology, public servants should be particularly sensitive to real, apparent or potential conflicts of interest that may arise from messages and information transmitted via the Internet and other media.</p><p>It is impossible to foresee every situation that could give rise to a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest. When in doubt, public servants should refer to the requirements found in this appendix, the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em> and their organization’s code of conduct to guide appropriate action. Public servants can also seek guidance from their manager, from their deputy head or his/her delegate.</p><p>In addition to the requirements outlined in this appendix, public servants are also required to observe any specific conduct requirements contained in the statutes governing their particular department or organization and their profession, where applicable.</p><h4>1. A public servant’s general responsibilities and duties include:</h4><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Taking all possible steps to recognize, prevent, report, and resolve any real, apparent or potential conflicts of interest between their official responsibilities and any of their private affairs;</li><li>Unless otherwise permitted in this appendix, refraining from having private interests, which would be unduly affected by government actions in which they participate, or of which they have knowledge or information;</li><li>Not knowingly taking advantage of, or benefiting from, information that is obtained in the course of their duties that is not available to the public;</li><li>Refraining from the direct or indirect use of, or allowing the direct or indirect use of government property of any kind, including property leased to the government, for anything other than officially approved activities;</li><li>Not assisting private entities or persons in their dealings with the government where this would result in preferential treatment of the entities or persons;</li><li>Not interfering in the dealings of private entities or persons with the government in order to inappropriately influence the outcome;</li><li>Maintaining the impartiality of the public service and not engaging in any outside or political activities that impair or could be seen to impair their ability to perform their duties in an objective or impartial manner; and</li><li>Ensuring that any real, apparent or potential conflict that arises between their private activities and their official responsibilities as a public servant is resolved in the public interest.</li></ol><h4>2. Requirements for preventing and dealing with situations of conflict of interest during employment:</h4><p>Public servants are required to report in writing to the deputy head, in accordance with their organization’s procedures, all outside activities, assets, liabilities and interests that might give rise to a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest in relation to their official duties. Such a report is to be made within 60 days of their initial appointment or any subsequent appointment, transfer or deployment.</p><p>On a regular basis thereafter, and every time a major change occurs in their personal affairs or official duties, every public servant is required to review his or her obligations under this policy, the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em> and their organizational code of conduct. If a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest exists, he or she is to file a report in a timely manner.</p><p>When negotiating financial arrangements with outside parties, public servants are to comply with the requirements listed in this appendix as well as other related directives or policies issued by the Treasury Board. When in doubt, public servants are to immediately report the situation to their managers in order to seek advice or direction on how to proceed.</p><h5>2.1 Assets and Liabilities</h5><p>Public servants are required to evaluate their assets and liabilities, taking into consideration the nature of their official duties and the characteristics of their assets. If there is any real, apparent or potential conflict of interest between the carrying out of their official duties and their assets or liabilities, they are to report this matter to their deputy head in a timely manner.</p><p>Where their deputy head determines that any of these assets or liabilities results in a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest in relation to their official duties, public servants may be required to divest those assets, or to take other measures to resolve the conflict. Public servants may not sell or transfer assets to family members or anyone else for the purpose of circumventing the compliance requirements.</p><p>The types of assets and liabilities that should be reported and the procedures for reporting and managing such assets and liabilities are set out in the <em>Directive on Reporting and Managing Financial Conflicts of Interest.</em></p><h5>2.2  Outside employment or activities</h5><p>Public servants may engage in employment outside the public service and take part in outside activities unless the employment or activities are likely to give rise to a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest or would undermine the impartiality of the public service or the objectivity of the public servant.</p><p>Public servants are required to provide a report to their deputy head when their outside employment or activities might subject them to demands incompatible with their official duties, or cast doubt on their ability to perform their duties or responsibilities in a completely objective manner. The deputy head may require that the outside activities be modified or terminated if it is determined that a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest exists.</p><p>Public servants who receive a benefit or income either directly or indirectly from a contract with the Government of Canada are required to report to their deputy head on such contractual or other arrangements. The deputy head will determine whether the arrangement presents a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest, and may require that the contract be modified or terminated.</p><h6>Political Activities</h6><p>Any public servant considering involvement in political activity should seek the advice of their manager, a designated departmental official, the Public Service Commission (PSC) or a human resources advisor before acting.</p><p>Public servants are required to seek and obtain permission from the PSC to seek nomination for or be a candidate in a federal, provincial, territorial, or municipal election, in accordance with Part 7 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/">Public Service Employment Act</a></em> (PSEA).</p><p>“Political activities” are defined in <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/page-25.html#h-31">Part 7 of the PSEA</a> as “any activity in support of, within or in opposition to a political party; carrying on any activity in support of or in opposition to a candidate before or during an election period; or, seeking nomination as or being a candidate in an election before or during the election period.”</p><p>Any public servant who wishes to engage in a political activity not covered by Part 7 of the PSEA that could constitute a conflict of interest is required to report the proposed activity to their deputy head.</p><p>Similarly, any public servant who is subject to this policy but who is not subject to Part 7 of the PSEA, including casual and part-time workers, who wishes to engage in any political activity that could constitute a conflict of interest, is to report the proposed activity to the deputy head.</p><h5>2.3 Gifts, hospitality and other benefits</h5><p>Public servants are expected to use their best judgment to avoid situations of real, apparent or potential conflict of interest by considering the following criteria on gifts, hospitality and other benefits and in keeping with the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector,</em> their organization’s code of conductand this policy.</p><p>Public servants are not to accept any gifts, hospitality or other benefits that may have a real, apparent or potential influence on their objectivity in carrying out their official duties and responsibilities or that may place them under obligation to the donor. This includes activities such as free or discounted admission to sporting and cultural events, travel or conferences.</p><p>The acceptance of gifts, hospitality and other benefits is permissible if they are infrequent and of minimal value, within the normal standards of courtesy or protocol, arise out of activities or events related to the official duties of the public servant concerned, and do not compromise or appear to compromise the integrity of the public servant concerned or of his or her organization.</p><p>Public servants are to seek written direction from their deputy head where it is impossible to decline gifts, hospitality or other benefits that do not meet the principles set out above, or where it is believed that there is sufficient benefit to the organization to warrant acceptance of certain types of hospitality.</p><h5>2.4 Solicitation</h5><p>With the exception of fundraising for such officially supported activities as the Government of Canada Workplace Charitable Campaign (GCWCC), public servants may not solicit gifts, hospitality, other benefits or transfers of economic value from a person, group or organization in the private sector who has dealings with the government. When fundraising for such official activities, public servants should ensure that they have prior written authorization from their deputy head in order to solicit donations, prizes or contributions in kind from external organizations or individuals.</p><p>Similarly, if an outside individual or entity, with whom the organization has past, present or potential official dealings, offers a benefit to the organization such as funding for an event or a donation of equipment, public servants are to consider whether any real, apparent or potential conflict of interest exists, and obtain the consent in writing of the deputy head prior to accepting any such benefit.</p><p>The deputy head may require that the activities be modified or terminated where it is determined that there is a real, potential or apparent conflict of interest or an obligation to the donor. These provisions are designed to ensure that this policy is consistent with <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-61.html#h-52">paragraph 121(1) (<em>c</em>) of the <em>Criminal Code</em></a>.</p><h5>2.5 Avoidance of preferential treatment</h5><p>Public servants are responsible for demonstrating objectivity and impartiality in the exercise of their duties and in their decision-making, whether related to staffing, financial awards or penalties to external parties, transfer payments, program operations or any other exercise of responsibility.</p><p>This means that they are prohibited from granting preferential treatment or advantages to family, friends or any other person or entity. They are not to offer extraordinary assistance to any entity or persons already dealing with the government without the knowledge and support of their supervisor. They also are not to disadvantage any entity or persons dealing with the government because of personal antagonism or bias.</p><p>Providing information that is publicly accessible is not considered preferential treatment.</p><h4>3. Requirements for preventing post-employment conflict of interest situations before and after leaving office:</h4><p>All public servants have a responsibility to minimize the possibility of real, apparent or potential conflict of interest between their most recent responsibilities within the federal public service and their subsequent employment outside the public service.</p><h5>3.1 Before leaving employment</h5><p>Before leaving their employment with the public service, all public servants are to disclose their intentions regarding any future outside employment or activities that may pose a risk of real, apparent or potential conflict of interest with their current responsibilities and discuss potential conflicts with their manager or their deputy head or his/her delegate.</p><h5>3.2 Post-employment limitation period for public servants in designated positions</h5><p>Deputy heads are responsible for designating positions of risk for post-employment conflict of interest situations as per section 6.1.2.(f)(i). of this policy.</p><p>Public servants in these designated positions are subject to a one-year limitation period after leaving office. Before leaving office and during this one-year limitation period, these public servants are to report to their deputy head all firm offers of employment or proposed activity outside the public service that could place them in a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest with their public service employment. They are also to disclose immediately the acceptance of any such offer. In addition, these public servants may not, during this one-year period, without their deputy head’s authorization:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>accept appointment to a board of directors of, or employment with, private entities with which they had significant official dealings during the period of one year immediately prior to the termination of their service. The official dealings in question may either be directly on the part of the public servant or through their subordinates;</li><li>make representations on behalf of persons or entities outside of the public service to any government organization with which  they had significant official dealings, during the period of one year  immediately prior to the termination of their service.<a href="#fn1" id="fnr1" name="fnr1" title="See Footnote 1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The official dealings in question may either be directly on the part of the public servant or through their subordinates; or</li><li>give advice to their clients or employer using information that is not publicly available concerning the programs or policies of the departments or organizations with which they were employed or with which they had a direct and substantial relationship.</li></ol><h5>3.3 Waiver or reduction of limitation period</h5><p>A public servant or former public servant may apply to the deputy head for a written waiver or reduction of the limitation period. The public servant is to provide sufficient information to assist the deputy head in making a determination as to whether to grant the waiver taking into consideration the following criteria:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>the circumstances under which the termination of their service occurred;</li><li>the general employment prospects of the public servant or former public servant;</li><li>the significance to the government of information possessed by the public servant or former public servant by virtue of that individual's position in the public service;</li><li>the desirability of a rapid transfer of the public servant's or former public servant's knowledge and skills from the government to private, other governmental or non-governmental sectors;</li><li>the degree to which the new employer might gain unfair commercial or private advantage by hiring the public servant or former public servant;</li><li>the authority and influence possessed by that individual while in the public service; and/or</li><li>any other consideration at the discretion of the deputy head.</li></ol><h4>4.  Resolution</h4><p>With respect to the arrangements necessary to prevent real, apparent or potential conflict of interest, or to comply with the requirements set out above, it is expected that situations will be resolved through discussion and agreement between the public servant and the deputy head or delegate. When a public servant and the deputy head or delegate disagree on the appropriate arrangements to resolve a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest, the disagreement will be resolved through the resolution procedures established by the deputy head.</p><h4>5.  Consequences</h4><p>A public servant who does not comply with the requirements set out in this appendix may be subject to disciplinary measures, up to and including termination of employment.</p></section></appendix></appendices><footnotes><footnote anchor="fn1" reference="fnr1" title="1" tooltip="Return to footnote reference 1">Assistant deputy ministers and their equivalents are subject to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-12.4/">Lobbying Act</a>.</em> In the case of any conflict between this policy and the Act, the Act takes precedence.</footnote></footnotes></doc>
