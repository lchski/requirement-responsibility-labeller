Introduction"><p>This document provides clarification regarding the new provisions of the <em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=794#234">
Public Service Labour Relations Act</a></em> (<em>PSLRA</em>) regarding exceptions to unfair labour practices as they 
relate to the use of employer facilities.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Legislative base"><p>Subsection 186(3) of the <em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=794#234">
PSLRA</a></em>, as promulgated by the <em>Public Service Modernization Act</em>, is an exception to the unfair labour 
practices outlined in subsections 186 (1) and (2). This sub clause was designed to reflect current realities.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Application"><p>The guidance in this document applies to departments and agencies listed under Schedules I and IV of the <em><a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=bill&amp;doc=C-25&amp;parl=37&amp;ses=2&amp;language=E&amp;File=668#192">
Financial Administration Act</a></em> and for which TBS is identified as the Employer (i.e., the

public administration</a>).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Terminology"><p>The definitions of various terms (e.g., bargaining agent, bargaining unit, board (PSLRB), employee, employer) used 
throughout this document are found in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/P-35/index.html"><acronym title="Public Service Labour Relations Act">PSLRA</acronym></a>.</p><p>For the purpose of these guidelines, the term "facilities" may include, but is not limited to premises controlled 
by the employer (e.g., structures and attendant land owned, leased or otherwise occupied by departments or agencies 
for whom the Treasury Board is the Employer), information and information distribution systems, and telecommunication 
equipment.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Limitations"><p>Sub clause (3) ensures that it is not an unfair labour practice for the employer to permit an employee representative 
to have discussions with the employer or otherwise attend to the employee organization's business during hours of work 
without a deduction in pay, or to use the employer's premises for meetings of the employee organization.</p><p>Given that employer facilities differ from department to department, and even from one facility to another in a 
department or agency, the extent to which departmental facilities are used for labour/management purposes is left to 
departments or agencies to work out with their bargaining agent representatives. Labour/management consultation committees, 
to be established in every department in accordance with Section 8 of the PSLRA, may be used as a forum by the parties 
to discuss how employer facilities will be used. However, some limitations must be respected. They include:</p><ul><li>the Employer cannot insist upon the union using their premises;</li><li>provisions already included in collective agreements and the <em>PSLRA</em> must be adhered to;</li><li>departmental policies regarding the use of electronic networks must be respected; etc.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Departmental practices"><p>Some organizations allow the use of their facilities for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>bargaining and planning sessions;</li><li>general meetings (regional or local decision, subject to operational requirements and availability of premises);</li><li>election of union executives and voting; or</li><li>distribution of information to members and potential members through a limited use of e-networks depending 
	on costing and technological requirements and with prior approval of content.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7.
