3 of the <em>Privacy Act</em></a>, including parent Crown corporations and
any wholly owned subsidiary of these corporations. </p><p>2.2 This directive does not apply to

requirements for "departments," as defined in <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-1.html#h-2">section 2 of the <em>Financial
Administration Act</em></a> (FAA) and referenced in <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-22.html">subsection
71(5) of the <em>Privacy Act</em></a>. </p><p>2.4 The directive does not apply to
the development of new legislation.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 The Government of Canada is
committed to ensuring that privacy protection is a core consideration in the
initial framing and subsequent administration of programs and activities
involving personal information. In recent years, Canadians and
parliamentarians have been concerned with the complex and sensitive privacy
issues that stem from proactive anti-terrorism measures, use of surveillance
and privacy-intrusive technology, sharing of personal information across
borders and threats to privacy posed by security breaches. Canadians want to be
informed of how their personal information is handled and assured of its
protection.</p><p>3.2 Under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>, a
collection or grouping of personal information is referred to as a personal
information bank (PIB). Under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>, heads
of government institutions are required to identify, describe and publicly
report their PIBs. The President of the Treasury Board, as designated Minister,
holds general responsibility for registering all PIBs and reviewing the manner
in which they are maintained and managed in all government institutions defined
in <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-1.html#h-3">section
3 of the <em>Privacy Act</em></a>. In addition to this general oversight role,
the President of the Treasury Board is responsible for reviewing and approving
new or substantially modified PIBs or establishing the terms and conditions for
such approval for the departments defined in <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-1.html#h-2">section
2 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (FAA)</a>. Under <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-22.html">subsection
71(6) of the <em>Privacy Act</em></a>, the President of the Treasury Board may
choose to delegate this authority to the departments defined <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-1.html#h-2">in section 2 of
the FAA</a>.
In making this determination, the President of the Treasury Board will consider
a department's compliance with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12510"><em>Policy on Privacy
Protection</em></a>, with this and other directives as well as with any
prescribed forms. The delegation for review and approval of PIBs can only be
given to the departments defined in <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-1.html#h-2">section
2 of the FAA</a>. Regardless of any such delegation, the President of the
Treasury Board remains responsible for the ongoing review of PIBs for all
government institutions that are subject to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>.</p><p>3.3 The <em>Directive on Privacy
Impact Assessment</em> (PIA) supports the President of the Treasury Board's
responsibilities by ensuring that privacy implications will be appropriately
identified, assessed and resolved before a new or substantially modified
program or activity involving personal information is implemented. Government
institutions routinely perform broad risk management activities and develop
risk profiles related to their programs and activities. The PIA is the
component of risk management that focuses on ensuring compliance with the <em>Privacy
Act</em> requirements and assessing the privacy implications of new or
substantially modified programs and activities involving personal information.
However, if not properly framed within an institution's broader risk management
framework, conducting a PIA can be a resource-intensive exercise. As such, the
government is committed to ensuring that a PIA is conducted in a manner that is
commensurate with the privacy risk identified and respects the operating
environment of the government institution.</p><p>3.4 This directive is issued pursuant
to <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-22.html">paragraph

relevant because the program or activity is common to all government
institutions, that the lead will be, unless otherwise established by an
arrangement or agreement, the government institution that either: </p><ul><li>is responsible for delivering the
program or activity across government;</li><li>is the contracting authority for
the program or activity; or</li><li>is the policy authority for the

or activity. In cases of joint programs or activities, an overarching or a multi-institutional
PIA is favoured. At a minimum, the approach will take into consideration the
approval process of the institutions involved and will cover the full scope of
the program or activity.</p><p>6.3.8 Overseeing the initial collection as well as any disclosures

10 of the <em>Privacy Act</em></a> or, in the case of a multi-institutional PIA,
the head or delegate of each government institution involved in the program or

the program or activity or, in the case of a multi-institutional PIA, the legal

whether the proposal is related to a new PIB or will substantially modify an
existing PIB. Existing PIBs are to be identified by their title, registration
number and bank number.</li><li>Short description of
the project, initiative or change.</li><li>In the case of a
multi-institutional PIA, the lead government institution will describe the approach for the completion and approval of the PIA in
support of the program or activity. At a minimum, a
multi-institutional PIA will identify the government institutions involved and
ensure that the role of each institution with respect to the program or
activity is adequately documented, unless otherwise determined by the approach.</li></ol><h3>Section IIâ€”Risk Area Identification and
Categorization</h3><p>The core PIA must include a completed risk identification and
categorization section as outlined below. To have consistent risk categories
and risk measurement across government institutions, standardized risk areas
(itemized below) and a common risk scale are to be maintained as the basis for
risk analysis.</p><p>The numbered risk scale is presented in an ascending order: the
first level (1) represents the lowest level of potential risk for the risk
area; the fourth level (4) represents the highest level of potential risk for
the given risk area.</p><p>The initial step of the analysis consists of evaluating each risk
area independently. The second step consists of grouping the individual results
to determine if a more in depth analysis is required. The greater the number of
risk areas identified as level 3 or 4, the more likely it is that specific risk
areas will need to be addressed in a more comprehensive manner.</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="widthFull"><tr class="lightgreyBG"><th scope="col" class="alignLeft">a) Type of program or activity</th><th scope="col" class="alignTopCenter width15">Risk scale</th></tr><tr><td>- Program or activity that does NOT involve a decision about an identifiable individual</td><td class="alignTopCenter">1</td></tr><tr><td>- Administration of program or activity and services</td><td class="alignTopCenter">2</td></tr><tr><td>- Compliance or regulatory investigations and enforcement</td><td class="alignTopCenter">3</td></tr><tr><td>- Criminal investigation and enforcement or national security</td><td class="alignTopCenter">4</td></tr></table><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="widthFull"><tr class="lightgreyBG"><th scope="col" class="alignLeft">b) Type of personal information involved and context</th><th scope="col" class="alignTopCenter width15">Risk scale</th></tr><tr><td>- Only personal
