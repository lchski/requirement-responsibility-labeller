<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><doc title="Policy Framework for People Management" documentID="19134" versionID="1" language="en" space="preserve" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="PolicyInstrumentSchema.xsd"><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="Effective date"><p>This
Framework is effective as of July 19, 2010,Â and applies to the core public
administration <a href="#fn1" title="See Footnote 1" id="fnr1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.  </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Context "><p>The federal public service
undertakes complex and diverse work developing policy and delivering programs
and services to Canadians. Effective
people management is a cornerstone of a high performing public service and a key
enabler in building Canadians' trust in and satisfaction with government.  </p><p>Over the
years, people management has evolved to keep pace with changes in the business
context.  New challenges of fast paced change, globalization, increasingly more
complex, diverse situations and fiscal considerations now have to be addressed
to ensure continuing excellence in public service.  </p><p>People
management goes beyond the transactional activities associated with
human resources to building a culture of excellence on foundations such as leadership,
values and ethics and employee engagement and development.  It is an integral
part of achieving operational objectives and requires sustained leadership and
investment of time and resources.  It also requires the engagement of managers,
employees, human resources practitioners, central organizations, and bargaining
agents.  </p><p>This
Framework outlines an approach to people management that builds on past changes
and further enables organizations to manage people in a way that best
accomplishes their business objectives. The approach is based on legislated
authorities, common principles, sound risk management practices and enhanced
collaboration between parties.  The application of this approach is expected to
achieve a public service that: </p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>Attracts,
recruits and retains talented individuals, and maximizes the potential of its <strong>workforce</strong>
to meet both current and future organizational needs;</li><li>Provides a <strong>workplace</strong>
where employees have meaningful work in a fair, safe, supportive and ethical
environment; </li><li>Fosters <strong>leadership</strong>
that sets clear direction, engages employees and demonstrates and promotes the
public service values and ethics; and </li><li>Invests in an <strong>infrastructure</strong>
of people and systems that enables high quality people management services. </li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Purpose"><p>The Framework sets out the principles that will guide the approach
to people management governance and the development of people management policy. 
It also sets out the principles that will effectively foster excellence in
people management.  Finally, the Framework clarifies the roles and
responsibilities of Treasury Board Secretariat, Office of the Chief Human
Resources Officer (OCHRO), deputy heads and several other parties in shaping
people management.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Principles"><p>The
following principles are fundamental to people management and apply to and
guide decisions related to:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li><strong>People
management governance</strong> (both within departments and across the core public administration):
 <ul><li>Recognition that
there exists an inter-dependency between the role of OCHRO and the deputy heads;
and </li><li>Deputy heads
have a responsibility in supporting the corporate people management agenda for
the public service. </li></ul></li><li><strong>People
management policy development:</strong><ul><li>Focuses on
priorities, areas of high risk or issues where a common approach is warranted;</li><li>Respects the primary
role and authority of deputy heads in exercising their responsibilities for
managing their employees; and</li><li>Provides
departments and agencies with people management flexibilities to respond to
their business needs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>People
management practice</strong>:  
 <ul><li>Leadership,
empowerment and employee engagement are fostered at all levels of the
organization;</li><li>Linguistic
duality and diversity of backgrounds and skills are reflected across the public
service;</li><li>A respectful
workplace is fostered through inclusiveness and meaningful dialogue with all
parties; </li><li>Trust and a
spirit of horizontal collaboration is cultivated; </li><li>Innovation and
creativity are nurtured and recognized; and</li><li>An effective people
management information infrastructure supports business success and
accountabilities.</li></ul></li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Roles and Responsibilities "><p><strong>Deputy
heads</strong> have primary
responsibility for the effective management of the people in their
organizations. In accordance with the principles above, they are responsible
for planning and implementing people management practices that deliver on their
operational objectives and for assessing their organization's people management
performance. They are also responsible for working individually and
collectively to foster a culture of people management excellence in the public
service. </p><p><strong>Other
key departmental players </strong>are the Heads of Human Resources, who have an essential role in
supporting deputy heads in fulfilling their responsibilities, as well as
departmental managers, who are responsible for ensuring effective people
management in all activities falling under their area of responsibility.</p><p>The <strong>Treasury Board</strong> may act on all matters relating to
people management unless otherwise provided for under legislation. For
example, those areas specifically conferred on the Public Service Commission
under the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em>.</p><p>The <strong>Treasury Board Secretariat, Office of the Chief Human
Resources Officer </strong>(OCHRO) supports the Treasury Board on matters regarding
people management and enables deputy heads in fulfilling their roles and
responsibilities for people management by: </p><ul><li>Developing broad
policy direction;</li><li>Assessing and
preparing reports on the state of people management in the public service;</li><li>Working with deputy
 heads and to develop people management capacity and to advance corporate people
management priorities; and</li><li>Establishing
common business processes and shared systems.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, it is responsible for the management of compensation,
including compensation planning <a href="#fn2" title="See Footnote 2" id="fnr2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and reporting, classification
standards, pensions and benefits, collective bargaining and effective labour
management-relations. Where warranted, it also leads corporate people
management projects and initiatives.  </p><p><strong>Other central organizations</strong> have key roles in government-wide
people management:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Privy
Council Office</strong> supports the Clerk in his role as Head of the Public Service
including identifying and driving specific public service-wide people
management priorities. </li><li>The <strong>Canada
School of Public Service</strong> has a legislated mandate to provide learning,
training and development in the public service and to assist deputy heads in
meeting the learning needs of their organizations.</li><li>The <strong>Public
Service Commission</strong> is responsible for independently safeguarding the integrity
of the staffing system and the non-partisanship of the public service.</li></ul><p>The <strong>Human
Resources Council</strong>, comprised of Heads of Human Resources, is an integral part in shaping a shared people management agenda and is
engaged through established governance structures. </p><p>The <strong>Bargaining
Agents</strong> represent unionized employees in the workplace. They are engaged by
the Treasury Board Secretariat, departments and other organizations in
meaningful consultations in areas such as the people management agenda and policy
development that could affect their membership.</p><p><strong>Other parties
</strong></p><p>A number of
other parties such as tribunals, commissions and boards have important roles
and responsibilities related to people management, as defined in legislation. 
Certain departments have people management responsibilities, such as Department
of Public Works and Government Services for administrative pay matters and the
Department of Human Resources and Skills Development for Worker's Compensation,
 Health and Safety issues.  For additional information regarding these parties
and others please see Section 9, "References".</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Monitoring and Reporting"><p>Specific
monitoring and reporting requirements are described in the individual policy
instruments associated with this Framework.  </p><p>The
Treasury Board Secretariat-OCHRO will use information gathered through its
monitoring and assessment activities to assess and to report, as necessary, on
the people management performance of individual organizations.  It will also
prepare an annual report to Parliament on the overall state of people
management in the public service.  </p><p>The
