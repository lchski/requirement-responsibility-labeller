It will be replaced by the <em>Directive on the Management of Projects and  Programmes</em>.</li><li>In June 2007, Treasury Board Ministers approved the <em>Policy on the Management of Projects</em>. This policy replaces the
	<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12077"><em>Project Management Policy</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12040"><em>Policy
	on the Management of Major Crown Projects</em></a>, and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12075"><em>Project
	Approval Policy</em></a>for departments and agencies as defined in Section 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial
	Administration Act</em></a>. This policy is a
	significant change in how government manages projects. As a result, Treasury
	Board Secretariat has adopted a phased implementation approach, starting in
	2007, that began with a group of departments that agreed to participate in a
	pilot.  Groups of remaining departments will be brought
	on board so that, by April 1, 2012, departments and agencies will have the
	systems and processes in place to meet the policy requirements.  In
	addition, based on lessons learned through the pilot, amendments to the<em>
	Policy on the Management of Projects</em> were approved and the 2009
	version of the policy effective December 10, 2009 was adopted.

defined in section 2 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration
Act</a></em>, unless
specific acts or regulations override it.</p><p>2.2 This policy applies to all Government of
Canada projects as defined in section 4 of this policy.</p><p>2.3 This policy does not apply to projects
funded by the federal government through transfer payments. The Treasury Board <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on
Transfer Payments</em></a> and its supporting directives provide direction on the management
and approval of projects funded through transfer payments.</p><p>2.4  The provisions in sections 6.2.2 and 7.1 relating to the
role of the Treasury Board Secretariat in monitoring compliance and directing
measures to be taken in response to non-compliance do not apply with respect to
the Office of the Auditor General, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the
Office of the Information Commissioner, the Office of the Chief Electoral
Officer, the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying, the Office of the
Commissioner of Official Languages and the Office of the Public Sector
Integrity Commissioner.  The deputy heads of these organizations are solely
responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with this policy within
their organizations, as well as for responding to cases of non-compliance in
accordance with any Treasury Board instruments providing principles and
guidance on the management of compliance.  When seeking Treasury Board approval
of projects as required under section 6.1.7, the deputy heads of these
organizations shall provide the Treasury Board Secretariat with any information
required for this purpose.  For greater certainty, the definition of "project"
contained in section 4.3 does not include the performance of audits,
investigations, or other statutory mandate activities of these organizations.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 The management of projects is key to
providing value for money and demonstrating sound stewardship in program
delivery. A comprehensive approach to managing projects, which is integrated
across the department and is appropriate for the level of project risk and
complexity, will enhance the likelihood of realizing project outcomes. This
approach should ensure that accountability for outcomes is clear, appropriate
controls are in place to minimize risk and limit project duplication and
overlap, key project stakeholders are consulted, and outputs and outcomes are
monitored and reported.</p><p>3.2 The management processes and controls for
individual projects will vary across organizations and horizontal initiatives,
reflecting differences in mandate, operational requirements, risks, complexity
and capacity.</p><p>3.3 An appropriate capacity for managing
projects, which reflects the level of project complexity and risk, and
integrates decision-making across projects, will support the achievement and
demonstration of value for money and sound stewardship. This appropriate
capacity will also ensure an optimal contribution to program, organizational,
horizontal and government outcomes.</p><p>3.4 This policy is issued pursuant to section
7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>.</p><p>3.5 Ministers have responsibility for the
administrationof projects in support of the mandated programs of their
departments. Deputy heads are responsible for the effective management of
projects according to legislation, regulations and Treasury Board policy
instruments that promote due diligence, ethical behaviour and sound management practices, thereby ensuring long-term
sustainability and value for Canadian taxpayers. They are also responsible for
ensuring projects are managed in a manner that fulfills any legal obligations
with respect to Aboriginal groups and that the honour
of the Crown is upheld.</p><p>3.6 This policy is framed by the principles
set out in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12022"><em>Policy
Framework for the Management of Assets and Acquired Services</em></a>. It is essential that this policy be implemented in conjunction
with related Treasury Board policies governing assets and acquired services.
These include the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18225"><em>Policy on Investment Planning</em></a>, the <em>Policy on Managing
Procurement</em>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062"><em>Policy
on Management of Materiel</em></a> and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042"><em>Policy
on the Management of Real Property</em></a>.</p><p>3.7 Treasury Board has delegated to the

Ministers limit the expenditure authority exercised by ministers in the
approval of projects.</p><p>The project approval limits set out in this
Appendix provide the threshold above which ministers must seek approval
(expenditure authority) from Treasury Board Ministers. Projects exceeding these
thresholds require the express approval (expenditure authority) of Treasury
Board. Project expenditures, which are not contracts, may be made by
departments when projects are within the limits established based on the class
of assessed project management capacity and the assessed project complexity and
risk. The basis for determining the capacity to manage projects is provided in
the <em>Standard for Organizational Project Management Capacity</em> and the
basis for determining the level of risk and complexity of a project is provided
in the <em>Standard for Project Complexity and Risk</em>.</p><p>Note that the authority
to proceed with projects differs from the authority to enter into contracts. Treasury Board approval is required for
contracts above the limits set out in Treasury Board policy. PWGSC is normally the
contracting authority for large, complex goods and services contracts for
departments, which is often the major cost of a project. This role is set out
in the <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act </em>and the <em>Defence Production</em><em> Act</em>.</p><p>The project approval limits are to be
regularly reviewed and revised, at least once every three years, normally as
part of the consideration of the department's investment plan as set out in the<em>
Policy on Investment Planning – Assets and Acquired Services. </em>Treasury
Board Secretariat may also make recommendations affecting the limits.</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="lightgreyBG"><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><strong>Assessed Project Management Capacity</strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><strong>Assessed Project Complexity and Risk</strong></th></tr><tr><td class="alignTop">Class 4</td><td class="alignTop"><strong>Level 4 – Transformational</strong><br /><strong>Level 3 – Evolutionary</strong><br /><strong>Level 2 – Tactical</strong><br /><strong>Level 1 – Sustaining</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop">Class 3</td><td class="alignTop"><strong>Level 3 – Evolutionary</strong><br /><strong>Level 2 – Tactical</strong><br /><strong>Level 1 – Sustaining</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop">Class 2</td><td class="alignTop"><strong>Level 2 – Tactical</strong><br /><strong>Level 1 – Sustaining</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop">Class 1</td><td class="alignTop"><strong>Level 1 – Sustaining</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="alignTop">Limited or no assessed capacity</td><td class="alignTop"><strong>$1 M</strong></td></tr></table></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B – Project Brief"><ol><li>A project brief provides Treasury Board Ministers or the department's approval authority with a clear understanding of the proposed initiative and is supported by a business case, project charter and project management plan.
