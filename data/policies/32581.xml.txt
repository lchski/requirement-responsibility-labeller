It does not contain any new mandatory requirements for settling claims against or by the Crown.  Examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and may not apply to all departments or situations.</p><p>The guide explains how to assess and manage various claims in accordance with the authorities set out in the above directives and with other payment authorities and government instruments.</p><p>Section 3 defines claims and sets out the principles of managing claims. It also highlights the importance of consulting departmental legal services when a claim is made against or by the Crown.</p><p>Section 4 explains the different types of claims, and identifies when the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a> applies.</p><p>Sections 5 and 6 outline the processes for managing claims against and by the Crown.</p><p>Section 7 discusses the accounting treatment of claims.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Overview of claims"><chapter anchor="3.1" title="Definition"><p>When an incident that results in losses, expenditures or damages occurs between two parties, one party may request compensation from the other by means of a claim.</p><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a> defines a claim as a request for compensation to cover losses, expenditures or damages sustained by the Crown or by another party (the claimant).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3.2" title="Manager’s responsibilities"><p>Managers who have been delegated authority to issue payments for claims against the Crown or who are considering making a claim by the Crown should:</p><ul><li>make sure that the claim:
            
                        <ul><li>meets the definition of a claim as set out in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a> (see subsection 3.1 of this guide)
                            </li><li>is treated in accordance with existing authorities, governing instruments or policies, when applicable (see subsection 4 of this guide)</li></ul></li><li>make every reasonable effort to obtain value for money when resolving the claim</li><li>consider the legal and other merits of the claim (see subsection 3.2.1 of this guide)</li><li>consider administrative expediency and cost-effectiveness of making or settling the claim</li><li>reduce the amount of the payment of a claim against the Crown when the acts or omissions of any person, including persons for whom a payment is being considered, contributed to the damages or loss incurred (see subsection 5.1.6 of this guide)</li></ul><chapter anchor="3.2.1" title="Importance of obtaining a legal opinion"><p>When an incident occurs, the delegated departmental manager is responsible for managing the risk associated with dealing with any claim that may arise between a department and other entities (for example, the claimant).</p><p>Because of the legal nature of claims, managers who are involved in a claim <strong>should</strong> always seek advice from their departmental legal services; however, in some situations, managers <strong>must</strong> consult them. For example, when a claim involves legal proceedings or when a payment of an amount greater than $25,000 is being considered, senior departmental managers must refer the claim to departmental legal services to determine whether any potential legal liability exists (as per subsection A.2.2.2.2 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>).</p><p>Claims involving Crown servants (either a claim against the Crown by Crown servants or a claim by the Crown against Crown servants) are generally negotiated by, or in conjunction with, the Department of Justice, without recourse to the courts, and according to the relevant authorities and procedures. “Crown servant” is defined in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>.</p></chapter></chapter></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Types of claims"><p>This section describes the different types of claims and identifies when the requirements of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a> apply. Claims must be treated in accordance with the applicable authorities, governing instruments or policies, as such:</p><ul><li>CFOs are responsible for establishing procedures for claims covered by other authorities, governing instruments or policies that are processed pursuant to those other authorities or instruments  (see subsection A.2.2.1.1.2 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>).
                </li><li>Managers with delegated authority to make payments for claims against the Crown must ensure that these payments are not covered by other authorities, governing instruments or policies (see subsection A.2.2.3.1.1 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>).
                </li></ul><p>Although some of the claims described in this section are covered under other authorities, governing instruments or policies and are therefore not covered under the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>, managers can still refer to this guide when managing claims because a number of the steps involved are applicable (for example, conducting an investigation, seeking a legal opinion).</p><chapter anchor="4.1" title="Claims in contract"><p>Claims in contract are to be dealt with according to the terms of the applicable contract and pursuant to the applicable law. Departments must ensure that the interests of the Crown are protected and that all legal rights are exercised. This type of claim is not governed by <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>.</p><p>For example, a department cancels a contract with a supplier. The supplier files a claim for contract‑related damages. The claim is contractual in nature and should be dealt with in accordance with the contract and the applicable law.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.2" title="Claims in tort (or extra-contractual liability in Quebec)"><p>Claims in tort, known as extra‑contractual liability claims in Quebec, are claims that do not arise in the context of a written, oral or implied contractual agreement. Claims in tort between the Crown and a claimant are subject to the requirements of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>.</p><p>For example, a federal government organization cut down a tree on federal property. When it fell, the tree damaged a neighbour’s personal property. The neighbour filed a claim for damages. That claim would be considered a claim in tort because the actions of the Crown resulted in losses of the neighbour’s personal property.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.3" title="Claims between departments"><p>As a general rule, one federal government department cannot claim damages and receive payment from another federal government department. Such claims are dealt with in a manner that precludes departments from seeking damages from each other (for example, on the basis of mutual forbearance).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.4" title="Claims between departments and Crown corporations"><p>Departments and Crown corporations use negotiated settlements to settle claims. However, when a claim is pursued, each party should voluntarily supply the other with all information in its possession. If the parties themselves cannot agree on the claim’s merits and liabilities, then the legal officers of both organizations should try to reach an agreement. If the legal officers cannot agree, then the matter is referred to the Deputy Attorney General of Canada for arbitration.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.5" title="Claims under the Canadian Human Rights Act"><p>Claims under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/">Canadian Human Rights Act</a> (CHRA) are subject to the investigation and conciliation requirements under the CHRA. The negotiation and payment of settlements and tribunal orders under the CHRA are subject to the requirements of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>.</p><p>The requirements of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a> do not apply to complaints relating to equal pay for work of equal value lodged under section 11 of the CHRA. Those complaints are dealt with through Treasury Board policy instruments relating to people management and through other authorities.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.6" title="Examples of claims covered by other governing instruments"><p>Table 1 lists examples of claims that are covered under other governing instruments and not under the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>. The instruments in the right‑hand column contain specific requirements for claims that arise in the situations listed in the left‑hand column. For example, claims by the Crown to recover losses of public money are covered under the Treasury Board <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32505">Directive on Public Money and Receivables</a>. These claims should therefore be treated in accordance with these policy instruments and not under the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32504">Directive on Payments</a>.</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><caption class="text-left">

This investigation is to be conducted with the assistance of the departmental security officials as required. See section 5.1.2 of this guide for more information on conducting an investigation.</p><p>When a Crown servant makes a claim against the Crown following an incident in which the Crown servant’s effects were damaged, lost, stolen or destroyed, the delegated departmental manager must investigate and consult with their departmental legal services to determine if there is any potential liability. The following criteria apply:</p><ul><li>Crown servants’ effects include only items considered to be reasonably related to the performance of the Crown servant’s duties at the time of the loss or damage.</li><li>Compensation is based on the full cost to replace the effects with the same or equivalent quality or the reasonable cost for repair.</li></ul><p>Ex gratia payments cannot be issued to employees of the Government of Canada. See the Guide to Ex Gratia Payments and Honorariums for more information.</p><p>For example, a Crown servant placed several file folders on a colleague’s desk and accidentally damaged the colleague’s eyeglasses. The colleague asked the manager for compensation to replace the damaged eyeglasses. The manager investigated and determined that this was an inadvertent incident that occurred during the performance of the Crown servant’s duties and that there was no other possible means of compensation. In this instance, the manager with the delegated authority may approve a payment to settle this claim.</p></chapter></chapter></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Claims by the Crown"><chapter anchor="6.1" title="Process when a claim is filed by the Crown"><p>Managers must make every reasonable effort to obtain value for money when resolving claims by the Crown.
