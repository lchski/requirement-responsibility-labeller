Preface"><section anchor="1.1" title="1.1 A more efficient and responsive public service"><p>The <em>Common Services Policy</em> sets a strategic direction and provides authority to reform administrative management 
and the role of common service organizations (CSO) to create a more streamlined, efficient, and responsive Public Service.</p><p>The government's White Paper on Public Service 2000, "The Renewal of the Public Service of Canada" (December 1990), 
describes the need for fundamental changes in the structure and management of the Public Service. These changes are necessary to equip 
federal public service employees for the 21st century and to enable them to function effectively in the context of continuing 
restraint.</p><p>The white paper sets clear directions for the provision of common services to assist program delivery:</p><div class="indent1"><p><em>The government will make optional as many common services as possible, maintaining mandatory services only where 
  there is an overriding reason. To this end, the Treasury Board will review all mandatory common services to determine 
  how they can become optional in a cost-effective manner.</em></p></div><p>Changes in the regimes for administrative policies and common services offer clear potential for streamlining, saving 
time and money, and giving more choice and flexibility to line managers. The white paper states the following:</p><div class="indent1"><p><em>With respect to administrative policies, central agencies, common service agencies, and departments will be expected 
  to:</em></p><ul><li><em>delegate authority as close as possible to the levels in the organization delivering the services to clients;</em></li><li><em>deregulate policies to ensure that managers and employees have more authority to provide services and 
    be accountable for their performance; and</em></li><li><em>assist managers to develop the necessary knowledge and skills to use this increased authority.</em></li></ul></div></section><section anchor="1.2" title="1.2 Responding to a new environment"><p>The government has used CSOs to obtain advantages from economies of scale and to seek benefits from the 
pooling of specialized expertise. In some instances, CSOs offer the convenience of one-stop shopping for 
departments and a single window to the government for private contractors. In other instances, CSOs provide 
government-wide repositories of information or offer the potential of fulfilling other government objectives.</p><p>These benefits must be weighed against other considerations in the current environment, such as the global costs of central 
supply; the widespread use of information technology in administration, purchasing, and communications; and the existence 
of a highly competitive and accessible marketplace.</p><p>As the demand increases for more streamlined, responsive, and cost-effective government operations, it may sometimes 
be more efficient for clients to have access to alternative sources of supply, including dealing directly with private sector 
suppliers.</p></section><section anchor="1.3" title="1.3 Choice and competition"><p>Optional services are based upon the dual principles of user choice and user pay. There are strong incentives 
for managers to be fiscally responsible when they have choice over the acquisition of goods and services 
and when costs are visible and billed directly to their operating budgets. Such an environment promotes 
quality management practices and accountability for operating efficiently among line departments. It gives 
them greater control and flexibility over the costs of their operation to best carry out their mission of 
service to the public.</p><p>Giving departments and agencies increased choice in how to meet their requirements promotes innovation and successful 
program delivery, particularly with respect to addressing unique mandates and operational requirements or to capitalizing 
on new opportunities.</p><p>Choice for line departments creates a competitive environment for CSOs. In a competitive environment, where CSOs operate 
on cost-recovery, market pressures cause the CSOs to focus on customer service, providing quality goods and services on 
time, and pricing competitively. This allows them to retain market share and operate a viable service organization. The 
CSOs have a natural interest in operating efficiently and being innovative in service delivery in order to remain viable 
and satisfy customer requirements. Such an environment contributes to increased opportunities for commercial suppliers to 
serve government where this provides best value and generally promotes more efficient and less costly government operations.</p><p>The philosophy promoted by this policy reflects international trends in the public and private sectors.</p><p>This policy is based on managers exercising sound judgment and authority, managing risk, and assuming clear accountability 
for their performance and results. It provides an accountability framework consistent with these expectations. Included 
is an accountability of departments to negotiate delegation instruments with CSOs or to seek exemptions from Treasury Board 
policies when these would better support the achievement of policy objectives.</p></section><section anchor="1.4" title="1.4 Mandatory service reviews"><p>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and CSOs will use the principles set out in this policy to conduct 
an intensive review of the mandatory services listed in Appendix E. Departments will be consulted about 
these reviews.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Policy objective"><p>The objective of this policy is to ensure that departments and agencies can acquire responsive, cost-effective 
support for their program delivery.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Policy statement"><p>CSOs will offer services to client departments in a manner that is most supportive of timely, effective, 
and economical delivery of programs to the public.</p><p>The government will make optional as many common services as possible, maintaining mandatory services only where there 
is an overriding reason. To this end, the Treasury Board will review all mandatory common services. If there is not an overriding 
reason to maintain their mandatory status, the Treasury Board will determine how the services can become optional in a cost-effective 
manner.</p><p>Departments may obtain optional services from a CSO on a negotiated basis.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Application"><p>This policy applies to the departments and agencies (hereinafter referred to as departments) listed in schedules 
I, I.1, and II of the Financial Administration Act and to commissions of inquiry designated as departments for 
purposes of the Act.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Policy requirements"><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 Use of mandatory services"><p>Departments must use mandatory services (listed in Appendix E of this policy) to meet their requirements.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Flexibility and delegation of authority"><p>CSOs that offer services that are mandatory under Treasury Board policy (as opposed to legislation) must 
deliver these services in a manner that allows and facilitates the maximum flexibility and delegation of 
authority to the departments they serve.</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="5.3 Compliance with policies and standards"><p>CSOs must comply with all government and Treasury Board policies and standards when providing common 
services. Departments must comply with the same policies and standards when they exercise direct authorities 
provided under this policy to meet their requirements for goods and services, including when they obtain 
delegation of authority from a CSO for mandatory services.</p></section><section anchor="5.4" title="5.4 Proposals for changes in status"><p>All proposals to change the status of common services must be presented to the Treasury Board for approval. 
Access by regional suppliers to government departments is to be included among the issues considered to 
support such proposals.</p><p>To avoid duplication and overlap and to permit an orderly phasing out of services to be terminated, departments must 
obtain Treasury Board approval to terminate existing mandatory or optional services, establish new services, or carry out 
services that individual departments now undertake.</p></section><section anchor="5.5" title="5.5 Exemptions from this policy"><p>Treasury Board approval is required when a department wishes to discontinue using all or part of a service 
that is mandatory under Treasury Board policy (as opposed to being mandatory through legislation).</p><p>In seeking exemptions from the Treasury Board respecting the use of services that are mandatory under Treasury Board 
policy (as opposed to legislation), departments must submit a business case to the Treasury Board that presents the anticipated 
advantages of granting an exemption.</p></section><section anchor="5.6" title="5.6 Funding of common services provided by CSOs"><p>As a guiding principle, mandatory services provided by CSOs are funded mainly through appropriation, 
and optional services are funded mainly by full cost-recovery through a revolving fund or net-voting authority. 
Mandatory services must not subsidize optional services.</p><p>For those mandatory services not funded by appropriation, rates charged to departments must be set to recover but not 
exceed the full costs of providing each specific service. All appropriate measures must be taken to reduce these costs to 
a minimum.</p><p>Unless otherwise directed by the minister responsible, where optional services are funded by a revolving fund, rates 
charged to departments must recover the full costs of the CSO in order to break even at the level of the overall operation 
over a reasonable period of time, such as the planning period for the CSO. Rates for a specific optional service, however, 
may be set by the CSO at competitive market rates.</p><p>CSOs must obtain Treasury Board approval for the rates to be charged to client departments for optional services and 
those mandatory services that are not funded by appropriation, except where the Treasury Board has authorized the CSO to 
set its rates directly.</p></section><section anchor="5.7" title="5.7 Services to Crown corporations and non-federal organizations"><p>A CSO may negotiate special arrangements to offer services to Crown corporations or non-federal organizations, 
provided that it is consistent with the mandate of the CSO, subject to the following conditions:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>specific approval of the minister responsible for the CSO is obtained with respect to the policy rationale and the 
  proposed scope (i.e. markets to be served) and terms (e.g. pricing, service line, and business volume) of the special 
  arrangements;</li><li>rates charged for services will recover but not exceed the full cost of the services provided; and</li><li>providing services to Crown corporations or non-federal organizations will not interfere with the CSO's primary role, 
  which is to provide services to federal departments.</li></ol></section><section anchor="5.8" title="5.8 Authority to compete"><p>The following CSO is authorized to engage in the competitive process to serve departments. Bids from 
this organization, when submitted, must be considered by departments at the same time as private sector 
bids and must be handled in the same manner:</p><ul><li>Canada School of Public Service for the provision of training consulting services.</li></ul></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Responsibilities"><p>The accountability framework described in Appendix A of this policy specifies the respective roles and responsibilities 
of CSOs, departments, and the Treasury Board for implementing the <em>Common Services Policy</em>. Instead of 
prescribing detailed central controls over how responsibilities are to be exercised, this framework emphasizes 
the nature and scope of the responsibilities, performance expectations, and monitoring and reporting requirements 
of these organizations.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7.

Introduction"><p>This accountability framework specifies the respective roles and responsibilities of common service organizations 
(CSO), departments, and the Treasury Board for implementing the <em>Common Services Policy</em>. Instead

the nature and scope of the responsibilities of these organizations, their performance expectations, and 
their monitoring and reporting requirements.</p></section><section anchor="A.2" title="2.

  the needs of client departments;</li><li>providing quality goods and services that meet the requirements and specifications of client departments in a timely 
  manner, while exercising a high regard for prudence, probity, and value for money;</li><li>developing, in consultation with client departments and agencies, meaningful and visible standards of service and 
  performance for the delivery of mandatory services, for example 
  <ol class="lower-alpha"><li>availability or accessibility (convenience to the user, response time);</li><li>service competence (quality, reliability, timeliness);</li><li>professionalism of staff (qualifications, product knowledge, service levels);</li><li>client orientation (courtesy of staff, choice, representation, complaint, and redress);</li><li>ease of administration (minimum paper burden, reporting in a manner that meets the requirements of client departments); 
    and</li><li>avoidance of unintended side effects (negative effects on the environment, increased risk in terms of health and 
    safety, or increased costs of program or service delivery);</li></ol></li><li>supporting the achievement of government-wide social, economic, and environmental objectives in acquiring or delivering 
  goods and services;</li><li>monitoring business volumes, levels of performance, resource use, financial results, and the implications of providing 
  individual common services and reporting on these factors annually in Part III of the Estimates or in annual reports;</li><li>on a periodic basis, conducting a systematic review and participating in Treasury Board reviews to assess mandatory 
  and optional services (The purpose of these reviews is to assess whether all or part of a mandatory service should remain 
  mandatory and, if so, determine whether increased delegation of authority and flexibility can be provided to departments. 
  Reviews of mandatory services must take into consideration how the common service in question can become optional in a 
  cost-effective manner. These reviews must also account for the issue of access to governmental opportunities for regional 
  suppliers. CSOs must seek the views of client departments when reviewing mandatory services. When CSOs undertake such 
  reviews directly and propose major changes to services, these changes must be approved by the Treasury Board); and</li><li>recommending to the Treasury Board the rates to be charged to client departments for the use of optional services 
  and those mandatory services that are not funded by appropriation, except where the Treasury Board has authorized the 
  CSO to set its rates directly. CSOs must consult client departments before recommending rates to the Treasury Board or 
  setting them directly.</li></ul></section><section anchor="A.3" title="3. Federal departments"><p>Federal departments, as users of common services, are accountable for the following:</p><ul><li>establishing an operating environment consistent with the <em>Common Services Policy</em>, i.e.
  oriented toward client service, promoting choice and flexibility for managers, and adopting a way of operating that is cost-effective, 
  business-like, and responsive to the operational requirements of the department;</li><li>determining the goods and services they need (i.e. what, when, and where) and whether they are receiving them 
  on time and in an efficient manner;</li><li>using mandatory services to meet their requirements when required by this policy and, whether using mandatory or optional 
  services, doing so in a business-like manner;</li><li>developing appropriate operating policies and monitoring procedures to assure proper use of all common service authorities, 
  including any special delegations obtained, and to ensure that departmental authorities are exercised in a manner consistent 
  with the provisions of this policy, taking corrective action when required;</li><li>supporting the achievement of government-wide social, economic, and environmental objectives when acquiring or delivering 
  goods and services; and</li><li>providing feedback on the implementation of this policy to central agency policy centres and CSOs.</li></ul><p>As clients of mandatory services, federal departments are accountable for the following:</p><ul><li>in the case of legislated mandatory services and services that may require ministerial delegation to exercise an authority 
  available on an optional basis, negotiating delegation instruments with CSOs when legislation permits and when delegation 
  would better support achieving the objectives of this policy or program objectives; and</li><li>in the case of services that are mandatory by Treasury Board policy, requesting exemptions from the policy when this 
  would better support achieving the objectives of this policy or program objectives.</li></ul><p>As clients of optional services or alternate sources of supply, federal departments are accountable for the following:</p><ul><li>making sound business decisions as to how they acquire goods and services, whether from CSOs or other sources of supply, 
  including internal supply, shared services with other departments, or suppliers outside of government;</li><li>acquiring services while maintaining a high regard for timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, prudence, probity, and 
  value for money;</li><li>considering the effect of the service on the public and accessibility by the public and developing guidelines and 
  criteria where appropriate; and</li><li>observing applicable legislation and Treasury Board policies when contracting with the private sector.</li></ul></section><section anchor="A.4" title="4. Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat"><p>The Treasury Board, through its Secretariat, is accountable for the following:</p><ul><li>evaluating the policy, including 
  <ol class="lower-alpha"><li>the integrity and continued relevance of the policy, and the common services provided under the policy, from the 
    perspective of whether they meet the needs of federal departments and agencies in terms of timeliness, cost, and quality 
    of goods and services;</li><li>the logic and practicality of policy requirements in achieving the stated objective;</li><li>the effectiveness of the policy in achieving the stated objective; and</li><li>the appropriateness of the policy in the context of overall government direction and changes in the management environment;</li></ol></li><li>reviewing and approving the fees charged by CSOs to client departments for providing mandatory (where applicable) 
  and optional common services (where the Treasury Board has authorized the CSO to set its rates directly, examining them 
  on a periodic basis to assure consistency with the principles established in this policy);</li><li>monitoring reviews of mandatory and optional services undertaken by CSOs and the follow-up action taken on the results 
  of the reviews;</li><li>when necessary, reviewing mandatory and optional services with the common service provider and, when applicable, with 
  other key departments involved (e.g. the Privy Council Office, the Public Service Commission of Canada, and policy departments, 
  such as Industry Canada) to determine whether 
  <ol class="lower-alpha"><li>the service is delivered in an appropriate manner;</li><li>mandatory services could become optional in a cost-effective manner or, if the service remains mandatory, whether 
    delegation of authority and flexibility to departments could be increased (assessment criteria for this purpose are 
    listed in Appendix D); and</li><li>the CSOs and departments are applying the principles contained in this policy;</li></ol></li><li>considering, when necessary, the resourcing implications for the CSO and departments receiving authority when a mandatory 
  service funded by appropriation becomes optional, or when there is a delegation of authority for a mandatory service funded 
  by appropriation;</li><li>monitoring CSOs and departments to assess the extent to which they are following policy principles and fulfilling 
  accountabilities under this policy;</li><li>seeking the views of client departments and CSOs when evaluating the policy or conducting related reviews; and</li><li>communicating with both CSOs and other departments to ensure that the policy is well understood and interpreted in 
  the spirit of public service renewal.</li></ul></section></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B – Common Service Organizations of the Government of Canada"><p>The following organizations are CSOs for purposes of the <em>Common Services Policy</em>:</p><ul><li>Canada School of Public Service</li><li>Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada</li><li>Human Resources and Social Development Canada – Service Canada</li><li>Justice Canada</li><li>Public Service Commission of Canada</li><li>Public Works and Government Services Canada (including the following special operating agencies)<ul><li>Consulting and Audit Canada</li><li>Translation Bureau</li></ul></li><li>Statistics Canada</li><li>Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat</li></ul></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C – Guidelines on Implementation and Best Practices"><section anchor="C.1" title="1. Use of optional services and services made optional through delegation"><p>Departments may choose to use the optional services listed in Appendix F when those services are available. 
They may also choose other methods to meet their requirements, including internal supply, arrangements with 
other departments or by special agreement with common services organizations (CSO), or arrangements with 
suppliers outside of the government.</p><p>In selecting the most suitable course of action to make an acquisition when a service is optional, departments should 
consider the effect on service to the public (as suppliers and purchasers of service) and access by the public. It may be 
desirable to develop operational guidelines and criteria for service levels to address these concerns.</p></section><section anchor="C.2" title="2. Delegation of authority"><p>Treasury Board encourages CSOs to delegate authority to departments to meet their special needs. Delegation 
instruments should clearly state the authority being delegated and specify only essential conditions related 
to exercising the delegated authority. The delegation instruments should clearly state that the minister 
or department receiving delegation is fully accountable for its use.</p><p>When seeking delegation of authority from a CSO for the use of mandatory common services, departments may be required 
to submit a business case to the CSO that presents the anticipated advantage of the requested delegation. The effects of 
resourcing on the department and the CSO should also be considered.</p><p>It is good practice for CSOs to facilitate the exchange of information with client departments so that they are aware 
of delegations of authority that have been granted as well as the essence of the business case that was accepted by the 
CSO for specific delegations. In cases where a business case is made and refused, the reasons for the refusal should be 
clearly communicated to all client departments that have an interest and to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat policy 
centre or other sponsor of the policy.</p></section><section anchor="C.3" title="3. Costing common services"><p>To estimate the full cost of providing optional services, CSOs and departments should refer to the Guide 
to the Costing of Outputs in the Government of Canada (Office of the Comptroller General, Treasury Board 
of Canada Secretariat).</p></section><section anchor="C.4" title="4. Cross-subsidization"><p>In principle, there should be no cross-subsidization between or among optional services.</p></section><section anchor="C.5" title="5. Changes to common services"><p>When a CSO seeks authority to establish new services or carry out services that individual departments 
now undertake, the Treasury Board will be guided by the principle that duplication or overlap of services 
offered by CSOs should be avoided. Duplication and overlap among CSOs reduce opportunities to achieve economies 
of scale, increase government overhead, and create confusion for client departments and the public.</p><p>As well CSOs involved in duplication and overlap of services as a result of past decisions should rationalize their services 
in these areas in a timely manner. However, when there are compelling reasons for CSOs to continue offering services that 
constitute duplication or overlap, the Treasury Board will, in reviewing its funding, be guided by the principle that they 
should be funded on the same basis to avoid giving one an advantage over the other (e.g. services funded under cost-recovery 
would find it very difficult to compete with those funded under appropriation).</p><p>When a CSO applies to terminate an optional service, the Treasury Board will be guided by the principles that optional 
services should be discontinued in an orderly manner when cost-effective alternatives exist or can be developed and when 
demand from within government cannot sustain the cost of such services being delivered by a CSO. Furthermore, Treasury Board 
will consider the extent to which affected departments, including small departments, have been consulted and have received 
adequate warning so that they can arrange for alternative methods of supply without disrupting their operations.</p></section><section anchor="C.6" title="6. Service to Crown corporations and non-federal organizations"><p>When CSOs are required to demonstrate a policy rationale for negotiating special arrangements to supply 
Crown corporations or non-federal organizations, i.e. a compelling justification for providing the 
proposed scope of service, they should take into account the interests of the public in limiting the growth 
of federal expenditures. They should also take into account the interests of federal departments in obtaining 
common services in a responsive manner and at a reasonable cost. An additional consideration is where increased 
scope of service leads to economies of scale that reduce the cost of services to departments or to the government 
overall.</p></section><section anchor="C.7" title="7. Appeal and redress"><p>CSOs should consider establishing a fair, impartial, and effective appeal and redress mechanism to deal 
with disputes or issues that arise when they are providing services to client departments.</p></section><section anchor="C.8" title="8. Performance management"><p>When providing for a department's service requirements, CSOs and departmental service units should review 
their practices in relation to the International Standard ISO 9004-2 (1991), <em>Quality management and 
quality system elements — Part II: Guidelines for services</em>, developed by the International Organization 
for Standardization.</p><p>The information note entitled Line Managers and Assessing Service to the Public (Office of the Comptroller General, April 
1991) provides useful information on establishing performance indicators on the level and quality of service as well as 
on client perceptions of service.</p><p>Managers of common services should ensure that they have relevant, timely, and reliable information about the performance 
of their programs. Performance information can be obtained through regular monitoring of service delivery and costs; periodic 
client feedback reports; quality assessments; and formal reviews, audits, and evaluations of the services provided. Performance 
information should be used to assure the quality and cost-effectiveness of service delivery to client departments, to improve 
policy and program decision making, and to demonstrate accountability for the efficient operation and results of the services 
offered, particularly to the responsible minister, the Treasury Board, and Parliament.</p><p>When considering the most efficient way to organize the delivery of a common service, managers should consult the Treasury 
Board guides entitled Stretching the Tax Dollar: Making the Organization More Efficient — which provides a methodology to 
examine how to deliver services more economically or efficiently, either in-house or through the private sector — and Stretching 
the Tax Dollar: Make or Buy? — which provides a method to compare the cost of in-house delivery with that of contracting 
out an identified service.</p></section><section anchor="C.9" title="9. Competition"><p>This policy does not provide authority for CSOs to engage in the competitive process to offer services 
to departments, Crown corporations, or non-federal organizations. CSOs that wish to compete with private 
sector firms should request Treasury Board authority through a submission setting out the policy basis and 
business case.</p><p>When CSOs package and broker private sector expertise on behalf of a client department, it is good practice to seek the 
minister's concurrence that such participation represents competition between private sector firms, not competition between 
government agencies and the private sector.</p></section><section anchor="C.10" title="10. Systems development"><p>When considering the development of computer systems to support departmental administrative requirements, 
e.g. finance, personnel, and materiel, departments should examine how state-of-the-art systems developed 
in other departments or jurisdictions or off-the-shelf products can be adapted to meet their needs. In other 
instances, consideration should be given to developing shared information and support systems solutions. 
This may save time and the expenditure of scarce human and financial resources.</p></section><section anchor="C.11" title="11. Environmental stewardship"><p>When acquiring and providing goods and services, departments and CSOs should apply environmentally responsible 
management practices and, in other respects, comply with the provisions of the Code of Environmental Stewardship<em> 
for the Government of Canada</em>.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="D" title="Appendix D – Assessment Framework for Reviews of Mandatory Services"><p>This framework is a guide for reviewing mandatory common services (listed in Appendix E of the policy) to 
determine whether the services should remain mandatory and, if so, whether increased delegation of authority 
and flexibility could be provided to departments. These criteria could also be adapted to help departments and 
common service organizations (CSO) assess the delivery of optional services.</p><p>This framework does not address the management issue of whether the CSO could improve its efficiency or the benefits 
it provides by changing the way the service is delivered. To examine this issue, CSOs and departments may wish to refer 
to the following publications: Stretching the Tax Dollar: Making the Organization More Efficient and Stretching the Tax 
Dollar: Make or Buy? (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat)</p><p>The following criteria include illustrative questions to guide the review of common services.</p><section anchor="D.1" title="1. Level of service requirement"><ul><li>How well does the common service currently meet the needs and expectations of client departments and 
  other stakeholders?</li><li>Can the required level of service be provided in a cost-effective manner by making the use of the 
  common service optional or by increasing delegation of authority to departments? Under what conditions?</li><li>How will be increased choice and flexibility affect levels of service to the public (e.g. purchasers 
  and suppliers)?</li></ul></section><section anchor="D.2" title="2. Service delivery arrangements"><ul><li>Is optionality expected to improve the delivery of services to the public?</li><li>Can the benefits provided by the common service be achieved by making the use of the common service 
  optional or increasing delegation of authority to departments?</li><li>Do client departments want the service to be optional in order to better meet their requirements?</li><li>How do alternative common service delivery methods affect access and service to the public?</li></ul></section><section anchor="D.3" title="3. Quality management and innovation"><ul><li>Does the mandatory provision of the common service promote quality management and innovation in service 
  delivery for common service providers and client departments?</li><li>Would increased choice and flexibility for client departments create incentives for cost reduction 
  and service delivery improvements?</li></ul></section><section anchor="D.4" title="4. Economy and good management"><ul><li>Does providing this service through a CSO demonstrate good management by offering best value to client

Introduction"><p>Certain services provided by common service organizations (CSO) are designated as mandatory (non-discretionary) 
when a government-wide interest or consideration prevails over, or coincides with, the interests of individual 
departments and agencies. Such considerations can include economies of scale; access to centres of expertise 
or specialization; the need for a high level of consistency; or attaining the government's social, economic, 
or environmental objectives. Other factors that come to bear include access by suppliers to government; 
access by the public, particularly outside the National Capital Region; and maintaining a standard of service 
to the public across the country.</p><p>This chapter lists mandatory services provided by CSOs to departments and agencies in accordance with legislation or 
Treasury Board policy. Departments must use these services for their requirements unless they are exempted by the Treasury 
Board or granted the necessary delegation of authority from the CSO.</p><p>Some departments do have existing authority to directly manage some of the mandatory services listed here. For example, 
National Defence manages parts of travel, legal, and removal services. This policy does not change the existing specific 
authorities of departments.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This notation (+) indicates a common service that is specifically mandated under legislation, not Treasury Board policy.</p></section><section anchor="E.2" title="2. Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada+"><h4>2.1 Procurement of goods, services, and real property in support of diplomatic and consular missions 
outside Canada</h4><p>Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (FAITC) manages the procurement of goods, services, and real property 
to meet its overseas requirements and those of other departments and agencies as a common service. These services are mandatory 
for departments to use when required to support Canada's diplomatic and consular missions abroad. This is consistent with 
the provisions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act whereby the minister is responsible for 
managing Canada's diplomatic and consular missions.</p><p>The services described here, when required for diplomatic or consular purposes, will be provided by the missions in their 
geographic areas.</p><h5>2.1.1 Acquisition of goods and services</h5><p>Missions abroad have been delegated purchasing authority outside Canada under the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services Act. Delegated officers of FAITC at missions abroad may purchase goods from firms located in the mission's vicinity 
when there is no access to offices of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) and this is the most practical 
and economical method of purchase.</p><p>Central supply of goods and services provides economies of scale; addresses security requirements in terms of leases, 
services (e.g. the hiring of staff), and goods (e.g. electronic equipment); and could provide diplomatic immunity for real 
property used for Government of Canada purposes (e.g. leases signed).</p><h5>2.1.2 Real property</h5><p>FAITC is the custodian of federal real property in support of diplomatic and consular purposes outside Canada.</p></section><section anchor="E.3" title="3. Health Canada"><h4>3.1 Public Service Health Program</h4><p>The Public Service Health Program provides occupational health and safety services to federal public service employees

medicine, environmental health, industrial hygiene, counselling, and management of health programs. Specialist engineering, 
scientific, and technical services are provided in support of front-line staff. Major service areas include health assessment 
and surveillance, workplace environmental assessment, health promotion and education, response to emergency situations, 
health counselling and advice to employees, and research and special studies. Through the Employee Assistance Program, professional 
advice is provided to departments to help them implement effective employee assistance programs. The Public Service Health 
Program also provides consultative advice to senior management regarding employee health and safety issues.</p></section><section anchor="E.4" title="4. Human Resources and Social Development Canada - Service Canada"><h4>4.1 Access Services (1 800 O-Canada; Canada Site; Consultation Postings; Publiservice)</h4><p>The <em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em> requires departments to register and to connect 
electronically with, and to provide up-to-date information to, various public access services managed by Human Resources 
and Social Development Canada – Service Canada.</p><p>These services include:</p><dl><dt><em>1 800 0-Canada</em></dt><dd>the Government of Canada's toll-free telephone service;</dd><dt><em>Canada Site</em> portal</dt><dd>the Government of Canada's primary site on the Internet (<a href="http://www.canada.gc.ca/" title="Government of Canada website">www.canada.gc.ca</a>);</dd><dt><em>Consultation Postings</em></dt><dd>information on national and regional public consultation and citizen engagement activities posted on the Canada Site (linked to departmental websites);</dd><dt><em>Publiservice</em></dt><dd>the Government of Canada's primary intranet portal for the Public Service (<a href="http://publiservice.gc.ca" title="Publiservice website">http://publiservice.gc.ca</a>).</dd></dl><p>These services provide the public and public servants with general information about government organizations, programs, 
services, events and initiatives, including public consultation and citizen engagement activities.</p><p>All <em>information provided to Canadians must adhere to key government standards as set out in policies and legislation, 
including the Communications Policy of the Government of Canada, the Federal Identity Program, the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Official Languages Act, the Privacy Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic 
Documents Act, and the Access to Information Act</em>. The <em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em> and 
its related <em>Procedures</em> elaborate on the specific requirements with which departments must comply so as to inform 
and serve Canadians.</p></section><section anchor="E.5" title="5. Justice Canada"><h4>5.1 Legal services to departments+</h4><p>Pursuant to the Department of Justice Act, Justice Canada is responsible for the legal affairs of the government as a 
whole and for providing legal services to individual departments and agencies through functions related to the offices of 
the Attorney General and the Minister of Justice. These services include providing legal advice, preparing legal documents, 
drafting legislation, regulating or conducting litigation, and overseeing all legal mechanisms used to achieve the overall 
objectives of the government.</p><p>In discharging these duties, the Minister of Justice weighs considerations of both law and government policy, including 
that in government bills, regulations, or departmental directives as they may affect fundamental rights or freedoms.</p><p>As the country's most senior legal officer, the Attorney General must see that governance is in accordance with the law. 
These services are centrally controlled in order to assure overall consistency and integrity of approach.</p><p>The <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> require that contracts for the performance of legal services may be entered 
into only by or under the authority of the Minister of Justice.</p></section><section anchor="E.6" title="6. Public Works and Government Services Canada"><h4>6.1 General</h4><p>PWGSC carries out certain central administrative functions on behalf of the federal government and provides optional 
and mandatory common services to government departments and agencies in support of their program objectives.</p><p>Departments must negotiate a signed delegation instrument from the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to 
exercise the following authorities on a delegated basis: printing, publishing, and related services.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: PWGSC is the designated custodian of general-purpose office facilities provided on an obligatory basis to departments 
and agencies and of other special federal facilities assigned to PWGSC under its residual responsibility for federal real 
property. This function is considered a program of government, not a common service.</p><p>A list of mandatory services follows.</p><h4>6.2 Appraisals for land conveyances</h4><p>PWGSC has sole authority for appraisals used for land conveyances. This arrangement relates to PWGSC's expertise and 
the management of risk in setting federal land values.</p><p>In the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut appraisals are a mandated requirement of the Territorial 
Lands Act and are made by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada.</p><h4>6.3 Expropriation+</h4><p>Under the Expropriation Act, only the Minister of Public Works and Government Services can authorize expropriations.</p><h4>6.4 Selection of private sector architectural and engineering professionals — SPEC</h4><p>Selection, Prequalification and Evaluation of Consultants (SPEC) is PWGSC's computer-assisted system for selecting consultants 
in architectural, engineering, and related fields for contracts. Use of SPEC is mandatory for selecting consultants for 
all contracts for architectural and engineering services funded by federal departments.</p><h4>6.5 Acquisitions service+</h4><p>The supply process is managed under the acquisitions service. Activities involve market research; product planning; and 
soliciting, evaluating, selecting, negotiating, issuing, and administering contracts, other supply arrangements, and services 
in support of acquisitions, e.g. systems support, statistics, and administrative support. The service involves acquiring 
a wide range of commodities from commercial, off-the-shelf goods to sophisticated engineering products and services.</p><p>Where <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has put them in place, departments are required 
to use instruments (standing offers, supply arrangements or other pre-negotiated multi-departmental instruments issued by
<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>) for commodities (including Temporary Help) listed 
in the Treasury Board Contracting Policy, Appendix C, Part 1, Basic Contracting Limits, Schedule 4. This requirement does 
not apply to contracting authorities listed in the Schedule to the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> and to Commissions 
established pursuant to the <em>Inquiries Act</em>.</p><p>Section 9 of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act gives the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services exclusive responsibility for the procurement of all goods as described in the Act. Other departments may only procure 
goods either when their legislation specifically permits it or when an appropriate delegation of authority has been made 
by the Minister of Public Works and Government Services.</p><h5>6.5.1 Research and development contracting</h5><p>PWGSC is responsible for all contracting relating to mission-oriented science and technology requirements in the natural 
sciences and the human science fields of urban, regional, and transportation studies.</p><h5>6.5.2 Executive vehicle acquisitions</h5><p>PWGSC is responsible for procuring executive vehicles for ministers, deputy ministers, and Federal Court justices. It 
is responsible for adhering to Treasury Board policy related to procuring executive vehicles, including providing automobile 
insurance required for these vehicles. Its expertise in this area provides clients with maximum value for money and a timely 
response to requirements that are often urgent.</p><h5>6.5.3 Guard services</h5><p>In 2006, the Treasury Board reaffirmed the Canadian Corps of Commissionaires' (Corps) long-standing exemption from competition 
and right of first refusal for Guard Services under the conditions in this policy.It is important to understand the authorities 
under which this preferential policy is applied:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Guard Services, including commissionaire services, are excluded from NAFTA Chapter 10</li><li>Guard Services of any type were not included in Canada's services commitments in the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement;</li><li>Article 507 (d) of the Agreement on Internal Trade does not apply to procurement contracts with a non-profit organization, 
  such as the Corps;</li><li>The Treasury Board confirmed the use of para 6 (c) of the Government Contracts Regulations in that it is not in the 
  public interest to solicit bids when contracting with veterans through this right of first refusal.</li></ol><p>PWGSC is authorized to enter into a multi-year procurement agreement with the Corps to provide for Guard Services related 
to safeguarding federal assets, information, persons, buildings and property owned or occupied by federal departments or 
agencies, including the following:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>intervention responsibilities such as access control/patrol of buildings and/or restricted areas using physical or 
  technological means;</li><li>custodial duties of information and assets, including locksmith responsibilities;</li><li>clerical and administrator duties related to the performance of guard services;</li><li>receptionist and information desk duties at building or restricted area access control points;</li><li>security scanning of incoming mail, parcels and freight at central receiving areas;</li><li>fingerprinting and other identification services (traditional, biometric, etc);</li><li>classified waste disposal.</li></ol><p>While it is recognized that guard services will contain "other related duties" necessary to performing the role such 
as reception, computer data entry, records management or chauffer services, the primary activities of guard services are 
as stated above.</p><p>For the purposes of this policy, veteran will be defined as:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>a veteran of the South African War;</li><li>a Canadian veteran of World War I or World War II;</li><li>a merchant navy veteran of World War I or World War II;</li><li>an allied veteran;</li><li>a Canadian dual service veteran;</li><li>an allied dual service veteran;</li><li>a Canadian Forces veteran;</li><li>a Canadian veteran of the Korean War;</li><li>former members of the RCMP that have been honourably discharged.</li></ol><p>A Canadian Forces veteran is an individual who was:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>a former member of the Canadian Forces who was qualified in his/her military occupation;</li><li>honourably discharged.</li></ol><p>The above definition of veteran recognizes the potential risk that all Canadian Forces members are exposed to when they 
swear the Oath of Allegiance.</p><p>The Corps will be required to provide the Contracting Authority at Public Works and Government Services Canada an annual attest audit by the end of June, validating the requirement that a minimum of 60 per cent of the hours worked nationally by the Corps on contracts awarded in each fiscal year under the right of first refusal is performed by veterans.</p><p>The failure of a Corps Division to meet the requirement that a minimum of 60 per cent of the hours worked by the Corps 
on contracts awarded in each fiscal year under the right of first refusal is performed by veterans, will result 
in the need for the Corps to take corrective action. Departments and agencies will not be permitted to raise new call-ups or post orders against existing standing offers for guard services, unless the Corps can attest to meeting the minimum authorized level of veteran participation. The Corps will not be offered the right of first refusal on new requirements for guard services until it achieves the 60 per cent requirement.</p><p>The Corps will be free to compete for contracts where a sufficient veterans population is unavailable.</p><p>PWGSC will conduct an annual contract cost audit to ensure that costs incurred and allocated are consistent with the 
Corps' status as a not-for-profit organization.</p><h4>6.6 Co-ordination of, and contracting for, advertising and paid announcements</h4><p>Public Works and Government Services Canada, in co-operation with the Privy Council Office (PCO), provides departments 
with a number of services to ensure the integrity and efficacy of government advertising. As required by the

departments must co-ordinate their intended advertising activities with PCO and PWGSC.</p><p>A definition of advertising is provided in the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12316">Communications 
Policy of the Government of Canada</a></em>.</p><p>All <em>advertising must adhere to key government standards as set out in policies and legislation, including the Communications 
Policy of the Government of Canada, the Federal Identity Program, the Contracting Policy, and the Official 
Languages Act</em>. The <em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em> and its related <em>Procedures</em> elaborate 
on the specific requirements with which departments must comply when placing advertisements.</p><p>The <em>Contracting Policy</em> gives PWGSC responsibility for contracting advertising.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Paid announcements, such as public notices regarding tenders, sales, public hearings, offers of employment, and business 
hours and addresses, may be placed directly with the media by departments and agencies.</p><h4>6.7 Co-ordination of, and contracting for, public opinion research</h4><p>Public Works and Government Services Canada provides departments with a number of services related to public opinion 
research. As required by the <em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em>, departments must co-ordinate their 
planning and implementation of public opinion research with PWGSC.</p><p>A definition of public opinion research is provided in the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12316">Communications Policy of 
the Government of Canada</a></em>.</p><p><em>All public opinion research must adhere to key government standards as set out in policies and legislation, including 
the Communications Policy of the Government of Canada, the Federal Identity Program, the Contracting 
Policy, the Official Languages Act, the Privacy Act, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em>. 
The <em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em> and its related <em>Procedures</em> elaborate on the 
specific requirements with which departments must comply when undertaking public opinion research.</p><p>The <em>Contracting Policy</em> gives PWGSC the exclusive responsibility for contracting for public opinion research.</p><h4>6.8 Compensation+</h4><p>Compensation services offered to departments and agencies are defined by legislation, regulation, and policies, and include 
collective agreements, pension Acts and insurance plans. Authority and responsibility for the pay and benefits function 
for federal public service employees are shared by all government departments and agencies. Treasury Board manages the compensation 
function, and individual departments and agencies administer day-to-day pay and benefit operations.</p><h4>6.9 Disposal of Surplus Moveable Crown Assets</h4><p>Under amendments to the Surplus Crown Assets Act, Treasury Board has established terms and conditions related to the 
disposal function. The <em>Policy for the Disposal of Surplus Moveable Crown Assets</em> elaborates on the specific requirements 
with which departments must comply when disposing of such assets. Crown Assets Distribution offers services to dispose of 
surplus materiel for departments and agencies.</p><p>Changes to the <em>Surplus Crown Act</em> also provide statutory authority for departments to spend an amount equivalent 
to the proceeds from the sale of surplus goods, subject to Treasury Board terms and conditions.</p><p>These changes do not affect the disposal authority some departments have under other legislation.</p><h4>6.10 Custody of securities</h4><p>Custody of securities is a Receiver General derivative function. Services are provided without charge under a memorandum 
of understanding (MOU) with the Bank of Canada, in support of the responsibilities of the Minister of Finance for Canada

oversees the Government Information Technology Standards Program. This program includes approving standards for government; 
formulating government positions, as a user, on proposed national and international standards; sharing information on standardization; 
and liaising with other governments and the private sector.</p><p>The work on information technology standardization is performed in partnership with departments to ensure that standards, 
and the criteria for their application and implementation, serve departments' requirements. All departments are invited 
to participate on new standardization initiatives. All departments vote on every proposed standard.</p><p>Implementing standards in accordance with approved criteria is mandatory for all departments, as directed by the Treasury 
Board's <em>Management of Information Technology Policy</em>. This ensures that only one set of standards is promulgated 
for use in the federal government. Common government standards increase the efficiency of government operations, allow fairer 
procurement, protect investment, support inter-working and portability among different vendors' systems, facilitate the 
sharing of applications and information, increase programmers' productivity, reduce the cost of conversions, and support 
Canadian industry.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="F" title="Appendix F – Optional Services"><section anchor="F.1" title="1. Introduction"><p>This appendix presents an illustrative list of services provided by common service organizations (CSO) 
to supply departmental requirements on an optional basis.</p><p>Optional services are based on the dual principles of user choice and user pay. There are strong incentives for managers 
to be fiscally responsible when they have choice over the acquisition of goods and services and when costs are visible and 
directly billed to their operating budgets. Such an environment promotes quality management practices and accountability 
for operating efficiently among line departments. It gives them greater control and flexibility, including over the costs 
of their operation, to best carry out their mission of service to the public.</p><p>Choice for line departments creates a competitive environment for CSOs. In a competitive environment, where CSOs operate 
on cost recovery, market pressures cause the CSOs to focus on customer service, the provision of quality goods and services 
on time, and competitive pricing. This allows them to retain market share and operate a viable service organization. The 
CSOs have a natural interest in operating efficiently and being innovative in service delivery in order to remain viable 
and satisfy customer requirements. Such an environment contributes to increased opportunities for commercial suppliers to 
serve government where this provides best value and generally promotes more efficient and less costly government operations.</p><p>To meet their requirements, departments may select from optional services provided by CSOs or arrange for other sources 
of supply, including internal supply, shared services with other departments, or suppliers outside of government.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Where this notation (+) occurs in the text, it refers to a common service that is specifically mandated under legislation, 
not under Treasury Board policy.</p></section><section anchor="F.2" title="2. Canada School of Public Service"><h4>2.1 General</h4><p>The Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) offers learning services to the Public Service of Canada. Detailed information 
about CSPS is available at: http://www.myschool-monecole.gc.ca</p><h4>2.2 Public Service Learning</h4><p>CSPS was established as a centre of excellence to provide quality training and development to departments and agencies 
in all regions of Canada. The CSPS curriculum is designed to support public service accountabilities and to respond to leadership 
competencies and government priorities.</p><p>Courses and programs offered by CSPS may be selected from its scheduled calendar or can be customized to meet individual 
departmental needs. All programs are offered in both French and English.</p><p>CSPS offers learning advisory services to assist departments in areas such as learning strategies, needs analyses and 
evaluation. Language training is available through the CSPS Language Training Centre. CSPS works with functional communities 
to establish professional development curricula for specialists in, for example, finance and internal audit, procurement, 
materiel management and real property, policy, communications, and human resources. Research on public administration is 
another CSPS service line.</p><h4>2.3 Training and development services</h4><h5>2.3.1 Needs analysis</h5><p>The needs analysis service is offered at many levels. At the functional group level, it could include occupational analysis 
for the Financial Administration Group (FI), the Purchasing and Supply Group (PG), and the Personnel Administration Group 
(PE). At the departmental level, it could involve developing or communicating a new program that affects all areas of the 
department. At the branch or program level, it could include implementing a new policy or managing change, and at the individual 
level, it could include determining the training requirements of a changing workforce as a result of changes in how business 
is done.</p><h5>2.3.2 Design and development</h5><p>This service offers course designs and development specially suited to address departmental needs, e.g., implementing 
a new informatics system in the department.</p><h5>2.3.3 Delivery</h5><p>Instructors are trained subject-matter experts in various disciplines. They can therefore either teach a departmentally
