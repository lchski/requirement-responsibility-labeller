Examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and may not apply to all departments or situations.</p><p>Section 4 of this guide defines low-value amounts under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a> (FAA).</p><p>Section 5 of this guide further elaborates on the elements under the regulations, such as the application of thresholds and accumulations.</p><p>Section 6 of this guide discusses the accounting treatment of low-value amounts.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Overview of low-value amounts"><p>On <time datetime="2015-04-01" class="nowrap">April 1, 2015</time>, amendments to the FAA and the regulations came into force, establishing requirements on when the Government of Canada would not collect or pay low-value amounts in the interest of administrative efficiencies.</p><p>This guide describes specifics of the following:</p><ul><li>the two low-value thresholds ($2.00 and $0.99)</li><li>what can be accumulated, for how long, and the exceptions</li><li>cases where the low-value amounts legislation and regulations do not apply</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Financial Administration Act: section 155.2, small amounts"><p>According to subsection 155.2(1) of the FAA, if an appropriate Minister, or any person authorized in writing by that Minister, determines that an amount is small, in that it does not exceed the threshold(s) set by the Treasury Board, that amount is deemed to be nil and is not to be collected or paid, with some exceptions. The applicable threshold are set out under the regulations (see Section 5 of this guide for more details).</p><section class="panel panel-default"><header class="panel-heading"><h2 class="h6">Delegation chart of spending and financial authorities for low-value amounts</h2></header><div class="panel-body"><p>The appropriate Minister, or any person authorized in writing by that Minister, determines whether the amount does not exceed the threshold. This requires a ministerial decision or a decision by someone authorized by the Minister. As a result, a department may choose to have a specific delegation in its delegation chart for such decisions. A person who has been authorized to sign off on sections 33 or 34 of the FAA may be an appropriate person, but it is up to the department to decide whether to have a delegation chart for low-value amounts and to decide what is appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p>A benefit of having a provision for low-value amounts in a department’s delegation chart is that the notes to the chart can describe the rules that apply to the department, as set out in this guide.</p></div></section><chapter anchor="4.1" title="Definition of “deemed to be nil”"><p>The regulations specify that the amount owed is zero if “deemed to be nil.” An amount is deemed to be nil if an appropriate Minister, or any other person authorized by that Minister, determines the following are at, or below the threshold established by the regulations:</p><ul><li>an amount owing by a person to the government (for example, receivables), or</li><li>an amount payable by the government to a person (including public sector employees)</li></ul><p>For receivables, if the amount is zero, there is nothing to collect and nothing to write off. Therefore, the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-94-602/">Debt Write-Off Regulations</a> do not apply.</p><p>The same principles apply for payables. Any amount payable by the government that is deemed to be nil is zero.</p><p>Once an amount is deemed to be nil, it should be removed from accounting records according to the accounting instructions referred to in section 6 of this guide.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.2" title="Terms and conditions deemed to be met for low-value amounts"><p>In accordance with subsection 155.2(3) of the FAA, if a low-value amount is not collected or paid (receivable or payable) because it is deemed nil, any requirements related to that amount are considered to be met. For example, making no payment of a low-value amount is not considered to be in default of a contract. No interest is owed on a low-value amount that has been deemed nil, so no interest is collected or paid.</p><p>In accordance with subsection 155.2(4) of the FAA, if a low-value amount is not paid (for payables only) because it is accumulating, any requirements related to that amount are considered to be met while it is accumulating (see sections 5.2 to 5.4 of this guide). The amount is not subject to interest during the accumulation period.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.3" title="Treatment of inconsistencies"><p>In accordance with subsection 155.2(5) of the FAA, section 155.2 of the FAA and the regulations supersede any provision of any act of Parliament, regulation, order, contract or arrangement, to the extent of any inconsistencies between these instruments. For example, a department has a contract with a supplier that specifies all amounts are to be paid. In accordance with section 155.2 of the FAA, low-value amounts at or below the applicable threshold would be deemed nil and not paid.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4.4" title="Exceptions"><p>In accordance with subsection 155.2(6) of the FAA, certain amounts are not subject to the low-value amounts legislation as follows:</p><ul><li>amounts owed by a third party<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> to a Crown corporation or amounts owed by a Crown corporation to a third party
                    </li><li>amounts related to public debt or interest on public debt</li><li>amounts owed to or by the government under certain tax statutes<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></li></ul><p>The regulations list other exemptions (see section 5.4 of this guide).</p><section class="panel panel-default"><header class="panel-heading"><h3 class="h6">Application of low-value amount thresholds to interdepartmental settlement transactions</h3></header><div class="panel-body"><p>The thresholds do not apply to interdepartmental settlement transactions. The regulations only apply to payments by a person to the government, payments by the government to a person, and amounts payable between Crown corporations and the government. See subsection 155.2(1) and paragraph 155.2(6)(a) of the FAA.</p></div></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4.5" title="Public debt"><p>The regulations do not apply to public debt or interest on public debt. In the context of paragraph 155.2(6)(b) of the FAA, public debt refers to the payment of principal and interest related to Canada’s outstanding debt obligations and reflects the borrowing authorities outlined in Part IV of the FAA. For example, low-value amounts for Canada Savings Bonds are included in the definition of “public debt.” Therefore, related bond payables or bond interest amounts of $2.00 or less must be paid. However, payments owed to suppliers, including any interest, are not covered in the definition of “public debt” and are subject to the $2.00 threshold.</p></chapter></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Low-Value Amounts Regulations"><p>Under the authority of subsection 155.2(2) of the FAA, the Treasury Board made the regulations, effective <time datetime="2015-04-01" class="nowrap">April 1, 2015</time>. The regulations cover thresholds, payment, accumulation of payments, and exemptions.</p><chapter anchor="5.1" title="Thresholds for low-value amounts"><p>The regulations establish two fixed thresholds for low-value amounts owed to or by the government as follows:</p><ul><li>$0.99 for payments under the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-8">Canada Pension Plan</a>, <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.6">Employment Insurance Act</a>, <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-9">Old Age Security Act</a> and any associated regulations made under these acts
                    </li><li>$2.00 in any other case</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="5.2" title="Accumulation of low-value payables"><p>An “accumulation of a payable” occurs when an amount at the applicable threshold or lower is held for a prescribed period of time until it:</p><ul><li>exceeds the threshold (due to the addition of the same type of payable for the same recipient) and is paid or</li><li>does not exceed the threshold and is deemed nil</li></ul><p>The regulations require specific types of payables to be accumulated when below the threshold over a period of time and paid, or thereafter deemed nil, as detailed below under section 5.3. There are no provisions in the regulations to accumulate low-value receivables. Apart from those specifically detailed in the regulations, all other payables and receivables should be deemed nil when they are at or below the applicable threshold.</p><p>According to the regulations, only specific types of payments must be accumulated, as detailed in the following table.</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><caption class="text-left">Table 1: accumulation of low-value amounts</caption><thead><tr class="active"><th scope="col">Specific type of payment</th><th scope="col">Regulations reference</th><th scope="col">Applicable threshold</th><th scope="col"><span>Period to accumulate and either:</span><br /><span class="mrgn-lft-md mrgn-tp-lg">1) pay within 30 days if threshold reached in period or</span><br /><span class="mrgn-lft-md">2) deem nil at end of the period</span></th></tr></thead><tfoot><tr><td colspan="4"><section class="wb-fnote"><h4 id="table1-fn" class="wb-inv">Note</h4><dl><dt>Table * Note 1</dt><dd id="table1-fn1"><p>Old Age Security, the Allowance and the Allowance for the Survivor are not accumulated but paid outright.

Both types of low-value amounts accumulate as described in the regulations, paragraph 3(1)(a).
