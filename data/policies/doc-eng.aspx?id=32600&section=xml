Acquiring  an asset imposes financial obligations over the entire life cycle of the asset,  from acquisition to disposal.  In addition, there can be significant differences in the financial obligations  required by:</p><ul><li>a  building that is constructed and maintained by the government</li><li>a  building that is acquired through a public-private partnership (P3)</li></ul><p><strong>Make-or-buy decisions:</strong> When decision-makers are considering whether to  develop and deliver a program, product, or service or to arrange to have  another department or the private sector do the work, they can use cost  estimates to determine the one-time and the ongoing costs of each option. For example,  a cost estimate can help determine the difference between the one-time and  ongoing costs of:</p><ul><li>developing  a new case management system </li><li>customizing  and maintaining an existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product </li></ul><p><strong>Decisions about  reorganizations:</strong> When decision-makers are considering a reorganization  that impacts two or more departments, or the creation of a new department, they  can use cost estimates to ensure that:</p><ul><li>all parties have a  complete understanding of the cost implications </li><li>the resulting reference levels are appropriate</li></ul><p>For  example, decisions about reorganizations would ensure that the reference levels  of both departments accurately reflect the cost of transferring responsibility  for a program, which should not only include the direct cost of the program but  also include the indirect cost of the internal services that support the  program.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Challenges and limitations"><p>Cost estimation for large government programs and  projects is a challenge. The number and magnitude of cost overruns highlight  the difficulties in developing and communicating accurate cost estimates.  Factors that lead to cost growth include:</p><ul><li>inadequate or poorly defined requirements</li><li>underestimated technical complexity or overestimated  technological readiness</li><li>inadequate project management and acquisition  practices</li><li>a cost estimate of poor quality, whether as a result  of inadequate data, methodology or poorly trained cost estimators</li></ul><p>This guide and the work of the Costing Centre of  Expertise aims to address poor quality cost estimates by increasing the  capacity to estimate costs in the Government of Canada. A concerted effort by  leadership in departments is required in order to mitigate the other causes of  cost overruns.</p><p>A cost estimate is a prediction about the future cost  of an investment based on the data and information available at a given point  in time. An estimate offers a snapshot-in-time based on available data, such as:</p><ul><li>how long it will take to build a capital asset</li><li>whether specialized contractors are available and how  much they will cost to hire</li><li>how many clients will access a service</li></ul><p>A cost estimate that provides a cost projection far  into the future is less certain and at greater risk of being inaccurate  compared to one that provides a cost projection for the near future.  </p><p>The best antidotes for the limitations and  vulnerabilities of a cost estimate are:</p><ul><li>an honest assessment of risk </li><li>a commitment to refreshing cost estimates as new  information becomes available</li></ul><p>A thorough assessment of risk will help decision-makers  allocate an appropriate contingency estimate, and this estimate will increase flexibility  when risks are realized. It  is important that the departmental culture avoid:</p><ul><li>being  overly optimistic when assessing risks </li><li>assuming  the best possible outcomes will be realized</li></ul><p>Decision-makers may be misled to believe that  sufficient resources have been approved for successful project execution if a  cost estimate does not adequately:</p><ul><li>assess risk due to optimism</li><li>incorporate appropriate responses</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Techniques to estimate costs"><p><strong>Best practice:</strong> The selection of cost-estimating techniques to  use is made in consultation with the Chief Financial Officer's organization.  The project or program manager should also consult with the departments Chief Information  Officer if the cost estimate includes an information technology or information  management component. </p><p>This section  describes five techniques that can be used to estimate costs. </p><p><strong>Activity-based costing:</strong> This technique uses historical cost information that  is compiled to align the cost of the proposed program or project with the  department's program architecture (that is, the categorization of cost  information by activity). The relevant costs are then categorized as direct or  indirect. Direct costs are fully assigned to the program or  project, and an appropriate portion of indirect costs are allocated to the  program or project. The cost allocations should be reasonable, consistent and  documented.</p><p><strong>Extrapolation from  actuals: </strong>This technique uses  actual cost experience or trends to estimate future costs for the same project.  For example, historical program expenditure data could be used to estimate the  cost of expanding the program. The technique can also be used after the  definition phase of a project because at that point, the project team has cost  information from the definition phase that can be used to estimate future  costs.</p><p><strong>Analogous:</strong> This technique uses the cost of something similar to  develop a cost estimate. For example, if the plan is to renovate a  teleconference facility, the first step would be to find a department that has  recently renovated a similar facility. Based on the amount that the other  department spent for their renovation, adjust the cost to reflect any  significant differences between the two renovations. Whenever possible, an  objective approach should be used to adjust for differences. Consulting an expert  to adjust for differences is considered a weaker approach because of the  subjective nature of the expert's opinion. However, even if an analogous cost  estimate is not the primary technique used to make a decision, it can be useful  as a reasonableness check on estimates developed using other techniques.</p><p><strong>Parametric:</strong> This technique applies statistical analysis to historical data from  similar initiatives to generate a cost estimate. For example, regression  analysis can be used to identify the relationship between the historical cost  of an initiative and one of the key characteristics (cost drivers) of the  initiative, such as:</p><ul><li>the number of full-time  equivalents (FTEs)</li><li>the computer processing  power required </li></ul><p>In the case of FTEs, the analysis would determine how the estimated cost  would change with each additional FTE. This technique is primarily used in the  early stages of development when an initiative is not yet well-defined and  there is limited data.</p><p><strong>Bottom-up :</strong> This technique involves breaking down a proposed program or project  into components. A cost is then estimated for each component based on the best  available information, and the component costs are accumulated to provide the  total estimated cost of the initiative. The technique relies on a good  understanding of the requirements and may not be appropriate in the early  stages of an initiative. If the initiative is a capital project, this technique  may also be referred to as an “engineering build-up.” This technique is generally used to estimate the cost  of a project while the activity-based costing technique described above, which  is similar, is generally used to estimate the cost of a program. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Steps to produce a cost estimate"><p>When  planning each step in the cost-estimate production process, these two factors  should be considered:</p><ul><li>The <strong>level of effort</strong> to develop a cost estimate should be  proportionate to factors such as:
  <ul><li>the importance of the initiative</li><li>the materiality of the initiative </li><li>the perceived risk of the initiative relative to the tolerance for risk</li><li>the level of experience with similar initiatives especially when new technologies  are involved</li></ul></li><li>The <strong>complexity</strong> of the planned initiative because the level  of complexity will help determine what resources are needed to produce the cost  estimate, such as the required knowledge, expertise and analytical tools
  </li></ul><h3 id="step1">Step 1: identify stakeholders,  the purpose and the boundaries</h3><p>Identify  stakeholders and determine their responsibilities. Stakeholders may include: </p><ul><li>the manager who is responsible for the new program</li><li>managers  of other programs that might be impacted by the new program</li><li>representatives  from internal service groups </li></ul><p>The  CFO should always be identified as a key stakeholder when a cost estimate is  being prepared for a Memorandum to Cabinet or a Treasury Board Submission. Key  stakeholders should be directly involved in the next three steps. </p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd"><li>Agree on  the<strong> purpose</strong> of the  cost estimate (for example, a cost estimate to support a request for project  approval).</li><li>Define  the <strong>scope</strong> of what activities will be included in  the estimate, for example:
    <ul><li>the full life-cycle cost for  a departmental asset</li><li>a limited estimate of the  ongoing cost to operate and maintain the asset</li></ul><p>A  common method for documenting and communicating the scope is a cost breakdown  structure (CBS), which breaks down a project into lower levels of detail. The  CBS is usually developed in conjunction with the project's work breakdown  structure (WBS) so that the schedule of costs align with the schedule of  activities required to complete the project. The CBS focuses on costing while  the WBS focuses on deliverables for program or project management. </p></li><li>Define  the <strong>time frame</strong> that the cost estimate will cover  (for example, the time required to implement a new program, ramp it up and have  it reach a steady state).</li></ol><h3 id="step2">Step 2: collect and normalize data  and establish ground rules and assumptions</h3><ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd"><li>Collect data that is needed to produce the cost  estimate (for example, historical expenditure data from a comparable program or  a similar IT system). The CBS, described in Step 1, helps to inform the  data-gathering process. </li><li>Normalize the data for consistency and  comparability. Data are gathered from a variety of sources and often come in  many different forms. Therefore, they should be adjusted before they can be  used for comparative analysis or to project future costs. For example, if a  comparable program exists in another country, normalizing would mean converting  the historical expenditure data into current Canadian dollars. </li><li>Establish  ground rules. Ground rules for estimating the cost of an initiative are  constraints that have been identified by a decision-maker. Potential  constraints can be identified by any stakeholder but, in order to be a ground  rule, they should be documented and approved by the responsible program or  project manager. An example of a ground rule is the statement of requirements  for a project (for example, compatibility with an existing IT or infrastructure  platform). </li><li>Assumptions  are used to fill gaps between the ground rules and the available data. For  example, the length of time the asset is expected to be in service, and the  level of use while the asset is in service. Typically, assumptions are used at  the beginning of the cost-estimating process when there is less data and less  certainty. As the estimate matures, assumptions are generally replaced by  ground rules and data. Assumptions will often be based on opinions from subject  matter experts. However, it is important that these opinions be:
    <ul><li>reasonable</li><li>consistent  with one another</li><li>supported  by data whenever possible </li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="step3">Step 3: create and adjust the  point estimate</h3><ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd"><li>Create a point estimate: 
    <ul><li>by using  the purpose, scope and time frame that were defined and agreed to by all key  stakeholders in Step 1 </li><li>that  is based on:
        <ul><li>the  data that was collected and normalized</li><li>the  ground rules and assumptions that were documented and approved in Step 2 </li></ul></li></ul><p>For multi-year investments, adjust  the point estimate for inflation.</p></li><li>Identify  risks that should be assessed, mitigated and monitored. Every investment is  exposed to schedule risk. Other risks to be considered include: 
    <ul><li>changes  in price</li><li>changes  in currency exchange rates</li><li>the availability  of specialized skill sets</li></ul></li><li>Provide  contextual information to decision-makers about the risks and the potential  variation in cost.</li><li>Explain  which inputs generate which costs (for example, adding an FTE generates salary  and employee benefit costs).</li><li>Provide  an understanding of how sensitive individual inputs are to change (for example,  if you add an additional item to a bulk purchase, how does that change the unit  cost?).</li><li>Provide  an understanding of the uncertainty associated with the estimate and the range  of possible outcomes. Uncertainty analysis is focused on the variability of  cost inputs and assumptions, which make the future cost of the investment  unpredictable. As a result, the final cost will likely not match the cost  estimate but will instead fall within a range of potential outcomes. </li><li>Determine  the appropriate dollar amount to set aside as a contingency in order to account  for risk and input variability. The objective of the contingency is to increase  the probability that the initiative will be successful within its approved  budget.</li><li>Document the  cost estimate. The level of documentation needed and the level of detail that the  documentation should contain should be proportionate to the level of effort  invested in developing the cost estimate. At a minimum, the level of detail in  the documentation should be sufficient to allow the reader to understand:
    <ul><li>the  cost-estimating technique that was used </li><li>the  cost-estimating process, the activities conducted and any limitations</li><li>the  overall results, including the maturity of the cost estimate</li><li>the  risk assessment, its findings and recommended contingency reserve (when  applicable)</li><li>how  the cost estimate was validated and any validation findings</li><li>how  the estimate meets all of the attributes of a credible cost estimate and can  support the Chief Financial Officer's attestation when an attestation is  required</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="step4">Step 4: validate, adjust and report</h3><ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd"><li>Validate the cost estimate by: 
    <ul><li>challenging the appropriateness of the cost-estimating technique that was used </li><li>ensuring that a strong, overall cost-estimating process was  followed and that each step was documented </li><li>challenging the estimate's assumptions for reasonableness and completeness </li><li>checking for errors by testing the accuracy of technical and mathematical aspects of the  estimating process </li><li>cross-checking  the estimate against recognized benchmarks or authoritative sources and explaining  material differences </li><li>providing an opportunity to improve the estimate </li><li>assessing the credibility of the cost estimate (refer to section 6 of this guide) </li></ul></li><li>Adjust  the cost estimate if necessary and determine its maturity </li><li>Report  the findings of the cost-estimating process</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Credible cost estimates"><p>Cost estimates should be credible, which  means that a cost estimate should be able to persuade decision-makers that the  project or program can be successfully implemented. The following seven  attributes define a credible cost estimate.
</p><ol class="lst-spcd"><li><strong>Participative :</strong> In order for a  cost estimate to be credible a wide range of stakeholders and subject matter  experts (for example, from the responsible manager to representatives of  internal services, such as information technology services) should participate  in its creation. This broad participation is essential to ensure that:
    <ul><li>requirements are well  defined</li><li>indirect impacts have been  identified</li><li>suitable sources of data are  selected</li><li>there is agreement on the  ground rules and assumptions</li><li>risk and uncertainty are  assessed</li></ul></li><li><strong>Comprehensive :</strong> A credible cost  estimate should clearly define boundaries in terms of time and scope. 
      <p>Time boundary</p><ul><li>For a new program, estimates  would typically include costs to:
           <ul><li>design and implement the new program</li><li>ramp up the new program</li><li>achieve  the program's first full year in a steady state </li></ul></li><li>For capital assets,  life-cycle costs: 
          <ul><li>start to accumulate at conception </li><li>continue through acquisition and the  useful life of the asset</li><li>include the cost of disposal</li></ul></li><li>When there are procurement options, it is  important to consider all the life-cycle costs of each option. For example, the  cost to operate and maintain an asset can often be several times higher  than the cost to acquire the asset, so these costs are material to the  procurement decision. </li><li>For program changes and  asset replacement, it is important to:
        <ul><li>look  at new costs and existing costs</li><li>consider  whether the existing costs are increasing, staying the same or decreasing</li></ul></li><li>For a program that has an  end date (also known as a “sun-setter”), the estimate would normally include: 
        <ul><li>costs  incurred for the duration of the program's existence</li><li>the  cost to wind down the program </li></ul></li></ul><p>Scope boundary </p><ul><li>The scope is defined as the  activities required to achieve the program or project objectives. For example,  the scope could range from the cost to procure the asset to the total cost of  procuring, operating, maintaining and disposing the asset. </li><li>Defining the scope  determines which costs are relevant. For example, indirect costs, such as  internal services, may be excluded from the scope of a project if it is  determined that there is no incremental impact on internal services.
      </li></ul></li><li><strong>Data driven:</strong> A credible cost  estimate is based on good quality data and not opinion. It is important to be  aware that collecting and normalizing data may require a significant investment  of time and effort. 
    <ul><li>Data  should be the best available and come from an objective, primary source (such  as the department's financial system) </li><li>If the  data is taken from a secondary source, any changes that were made after the  data was extracted from its primary source should be documented </li><li>Data  should be up to date (for example, if using financial data, it should be from  the most recent fiscal period) </li><li>Data  should be normalized (for example, if the data is in a foreign currency, it  should be converted to Canadian dollars) </li></ul></li><li> <strong>Risk-assessed :</strong> A credible cost  estimate is a prediction of a future outcome that includes a risk assessment.  In order to understand the risk associated with an initiative and the  recommended response, a risk assessment should be sufficiently detailed so that  the assessment's basis, process, level of subjectivity and findings can be  understood. 
  
      <p>A rigorous risk assessment would:</p><ul><li>be data driven and  quantitative</li><li>use statistical  analysis</li></ul><p>A less rigorous risk assessment could be based on  intuition and qualitative analysis. For example, a less rigorous risk  assessment:</p><ul><li>might only focus on  determining the schedule risk </li><li>could assume that the  probability of a risk occurring and its potential impact are not material</li></ul><p>Qualitative and quantitative risk analyses are often  used together. Qualitative or subjective analysis can be used to help rank the  priority of risks before more resource-intensive quantitative analysis is conducted. For both qualitative and quantitative  analyses, it is important to document:</p><ul><li>how the analysis was done</li><li>the results of the  analysis</li><li>how the results were  taken into consideration
          </li></ul></li><li><strong>Accurate :</strong> In order to produce a credible cost estimate: 
    <ul><li>the appropriate  cost-estimating techniques should be used </li><li>the estimates of  requirements for future years should be adjusted for inflation</li><li>the cost estimate should  be validated</li></ul><p>The choice of cost-estimating  technique is influenced by a number of factors, such as the maturity of the  initiative and the availability of suitable data (refer to section 4 of  this guide). </p><p>A cost estimate is a prediction of a future cost and  should therefore be adjusted to take inflation into account. Doing so is  particularly important:</p><ul><li>for long-term  initiatives</li><li>during periods of  high inflation</li></ul><p>Not adjusting the estimate for inflation would mean  that the initiative will be under funded in future years.</p><p>The scope of the validation exercise of a cost  estimate and its findings should be documented. Depending on the materiality  and complexity of an initiative, management may decide that the validation  should be completed by an independent third-party because it would be perceived  as more credible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevant :</strong> A credible cost estimate is relevant if it is current (for  example, the estimate is based on expenditure data from the last complete  fiscal period). To ensure that a cost estimate is relevant, it should be  updated before a decision is made about a program or project. </p><p>For large, complex and risky initiatives, management should  consider updating the cost estimate periodically in order to monitor progress (for  example, to compare estimates to actuals). This approach could also provide  early insight into problems and support targeted management responses.</p></li><li><strong>Documented :</strong> A credible cost estimate should be documented in a cost-estimate  report to ensure informed decision-making. The documentation should:

  <ul><li>provide a thorough understanding of how the  estimate was produced</li><li>allow readers to assess the credibility and  maturity of the estimate</li><li>be able to withstand scrutiny and an audit</li><li>allow a third party to reproduce the results</li></ul></li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="Responsibilities"><p>Developing  cost estimates is a collaborative  effort that involves multiple stakeholders who have a range of knowledge and expertise.

However, for practical reasons the role of the reviewer is  often filled by someone who reports to the program or project manager.  Management may want to revisit the reporting relationship of the cost estimator  when the level of complexity or materiality of the initiative is significant.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="References"><p>It is  recommended that the following sources be read in conjunction with this guide: </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/treasury-board-submissions.html">Treasury Board Submissions</a></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27256">Guideline on Chief Financial Officer Attestation for  Cabinet Submissions</a></em></li><li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/risk-management.html">Risk Management </a></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18225">Policy on Investment Planning: Assets and Acquired Services</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy on the Management of Projects</a></em></li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="9" title="Useful links"><ul><li><a href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Cost_Estimating_Community_of_Practice">Cost Estimating Community of Practice</a> (accessible  only on the Government of Canada network)</li><li><em><a href="http://www.iceaaonline.com/cebok/">Cost  Estimating Body of Knowledge</a></em> (publication of the  International Cost Estimating and Analysis Association, which is available for  purchase)</li><li><em><a href="https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d093sp.pdf">Government Accountability Office Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide</a></em> (guide published  by the United States Government)</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="10" title="Enquiries"><p>Members of  the public may contact <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/corporate/contact.html">Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Public Enquiries</a> if they  have questions about this guide. </p><p>Individuals  from departments may contact Financial Management Enquiries at <a href="mailto:fin-www@tbs-sct.gc.ca">fin-www@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a> for interpretation of this guide. </p></chapter></chapters><appendices><appendix anchor="A" title="Appendix A: glossary"><p>The glossary defines  the terms that are commonly used when producing or using cost information in  the Government of Canada.

In  practice, if there is a separate and distinct cost that can be quantified, it  should be listed as a cost element unless it is considered to be immaterial.</dd><dt><strong>direct and indirect costs</strong></dt><dd>Costs are  considered direct when they are incurred solely to support the initiative.  Costs are considered indirect when they are incurred to support more than one  initiative and are not attributed only to the initiative that is being costed. </dd><dt><strong>ground rules and assumptions</strong></dt><dd>Ground rules are  constraints or boundaries that have been established by the decision-maker.  Assumptions are used to fill the gaps between the ground rules and the  available data.</dd><dt><strong>incremental cost</strong></dt><dd>The increase or  decrease in costs that results from a change in the initiative (for example, a  change in the cost of a service when the level of service is increased). </dd><dt><strong>learning curve</strong></dt><dd>An increase in  efficiency based on improved knowledge and familiarity with a task or a series  of tasks that can impact costs. The impact of a learning curve can be seen in a  recurring activity, but also in tasks or projects that are similar. An  initiative may be impacted by several different learning curves. For example, a learning curve could  impact costs if the assumptions about productivity are wrong (such as if  productivity increases more slowly than expected during implementation). </dd><dt><strong>life-cycle cost</strong></dt><dd>All the costs  associated with an initiative over its life cycle, which would be the costs  from initial conception until the end the program or the disposal of the asset.  There are generally four phases in life-cycle costing, which are described  differently depending on whether the project is an asset or a program.</dd><dt>An <strong>asset's life-cycle cost</strong> has the following four phases: </dt><dd><ol><li>Planning: This  phase is composed of defining requirements, selecting options and planning,  which can include research, design and prototyping.</li><li>Acquisition:  This phase is composed of acquiring a capital asset or improving an existing  capital asset. The phase could also include coordination and support activities,  such as those performed by the project management office.</li><li>Sustainment and  operations: This phase continues throughout the asset's useful life. </li><li>Disposal and remediation: This phase includes clean-up costs  (see the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/greening-government/strategy.html">Greening  Government Strategy</a>), which would be subtracted from the residual  value of the asset.</li></ol></dd><dt>A <strong>program's life-cycle costs</strong> have the following four phases:</dt><dd><ol><li>Planning: This phase is composed of  activities that result in a design for a program and a plan for implementation  and ongoing operations.</li><li>Ramp-up: This phase is composed of  activities to implement a program.</li><li>Ongoing or steady state: This phase  is composed of activities required to operate the program.</li><li>Wind down or sunset: This phase is  composed of activities required to wind down the program.</li></ol></dd><dt><strong>materiality</strong></dt><dd>The degree  to which something is important, relevant or significant. From a  decision-making perspective, an item of information or an aggregate of items is  material if it is probable that its omission or misstatement could influence or  change a decision. For example, a component that costs $1,000 and is part of a  $1 million initiative is not likely to be considered material. However, a  $1 million initiative would be material for an organization that has a  budget of $20 million. </dd><dt><strong>maturity of a cost  estimate</strong></dt><dd><p>The maturity and the  associated quality of a cost estimate should improve as the initiative  progresses because, as an initiative progresses, the level of uncertainty is  expected to decrease. </p><p>Improvements in the  maturity and quality reflect the fact that:</p><ul><li>the requirements are  better defined</li><li>the data that is used  to estimate future costs is more readily available and of a higher quality initiative</li></ul><p>When a program or  project reaches a decision point, the maturity and quality of the cost estimate  that is used to support the decision should be appropriate to the decision (for  example, rough order of magnitude, indicative, or substantive).

Data are  gathered from a variety of sources and often come in many different forms. The  data should be adjusted before they can be used for comparative analysis or as  a basis for projecting future costs. Data can be normalized according to fiscal  year, currency, cost per unit, size or weight, key groupings, and technological  maturity (that is, adjusted for productivity improvements). </dd><dt><strong>opportunity cost</strong></dt><dd>Among a set  of possible actions, the potential gain from a course of action that was not  taken. Opportunity cost can be quantified during cost estimating, but the resources  that are quantified are not always financial. Depending on the circumstances,  the resources could include items such as time, labour, human health and the  environment. For example, there is a limit to how many people a department can  have on staff, so there is an opportunity cost when staff are assigned to one  initiative because that means they cannot be assigned to other initiatives.</dd><dt><strong>point estimate</strong></dt><dd>A single value that  is used for communication or approval purposes to represent the actual cost of  an initiative, which is selected from somewhere within a range of potential  outcomes. The point estimate is also used to establish the limit of funds that  are allocated to an initiative. The point estimate can be adjusted for risk by  adding a contingency reserve. If the estimate is adjusted, the amount of the  adjustment should be identified and explained.</dd><dt><strong>risk tolerance</strong></dt><dd> The degree  to which an organization is willing to accept or reject a given level of  residual risk. Risk tolerance may differ across the organization and by  initiative. Risk tolerance helps inform risk-related decisions. </dd></dl></appendix></appendices></doc>
