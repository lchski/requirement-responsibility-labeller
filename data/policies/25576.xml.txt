Introduction"><p>As highlighted in Budget 2011, the Government of Canada aims to explore the use of public-private partnerships (<abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s) 
to the greatest extent possible to ensure value for money. For this reason, all federal departments and agencies are required 
to screen large infrastructure projects to determine whether they are potential candidates for a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> delivery model. PPP 
Canada, which was established to provide a federal centre of expertise for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s, has the mandate to assess projects for their 
<abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> potential. As such, departments are required to consult PPP Canada in applying the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen to their projects. This 
guide builds on Budget 2011 by providing federal organizations with <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screening and value for money considerations. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Background"><p>A <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is an infrastructure delivery model that integrates the various phases of the asset life cycle into one long-term 
performance-based agreement. Through the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> model, the government can transfer to the private sector many of the risks and 
responsibilities of the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of federal infrastructure. </p><p>Certain Canadian provinces and international jurisdictions have extensive experience and successes with <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s, while the 
Government of Canada's experience has been limited primarily to a few recent examples. The Government of Canada is looking 
to build on this recent experience. </p><p>A fundamental principle of Government of Canada policies is value for money; this is the criterion by which all investment 
decisions are assessed. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Purpose"><p>The purpose of this guide is to support the Budget 2011 policy direction on <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s by:</p><ul><li>Creating a common understanding of what is meant by <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s in the federal context and providing resources for federal 
	organizations considering <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s;</li><li>Providing advice on screening considerations for federal organizations in line with the Budget 2011 policy direction;</li><li>Outlining other policy considerations for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s, including the key policy objective of ensuring value for money; and
	</li><li>Outlining considerations for federal organizations in assessing value for money.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Definition of Public-Private Partnerships and Resources"><section anchor="4.1" title="Definition of a P3"><p>PPP Canada defines a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> as a long-term contractual relationship between a public authority and the private sector that 
involves the following:</p><ul><li>Provision of goods or services to meet a defined output specification (i.e., defining what is required, rather than 
	how it is to be done);</li><li>Integration of multiple project phases (e.g., design, construction, operations);</li><li>Transfer of risk to the private sector, which is anchored with private sector capital at risk; and</li><li>A performance-based payment mechanism.</li></ul><p><abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s can take the form of a number of different models that vary according to the level of private sector involvement. 
At one end of the spectrum is the Design-Build-Finance (<abbr title="Design-Build-Finance">DBF</abbr>) delivery model where the private sector is responsible for 
designing, building, and financing the construction of the asset.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum are Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (<abbr title="Design-Build-Finance-Maintain">DBFM</abbr>) or Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (<abbr title="Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain">DBFOM</abbr>) 
delivery models. Using these models, the private sector designs, builds, finances, maintains and operates (in the <abbr title="Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain">DBFOM</abbr> 
model) the asset(s) to predetermined output specifications. <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s are governed by one performance-based agreement. The government 
makes a series of payments to the private sector that may be subject to a holdback provision if the obligations are not 
met according to the predetermined performance specifications.</p></section><section anchor="4.2" title="P3 Resources"><p>In 2008, the Government of Canada established PPP Canada, a federal Crown corporation, to advance federal efforts to 
increase the effective use of <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s in Canada. PPP Canada advises departments and agencies in support of <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s and assesses 
federal <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> opportunities. It also provides information and support services to departments and agencies considering a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> 
option. </p><p>Public Works and Government Services Canada (<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>) is the designated custodian of general-purpose office accommodation 
in Canada. In addition, under the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/P-38.2/index.html">Department of Public Works 
and Government Services Act</a></em>, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> is a common service organization that provides real property services to federal 
organizations within Canada. <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> can provide guidance and support to departments and agencies considering a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> as a potential 
delivery model for accommodation projects.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Budget 2011 and P3 Screening"><p>Budget 2011 requires that federal departments and agencies assess large capital projects for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> potential and states:
</p><blockquote><p>Going forward, federal departments will be required to evaluate the potential for using a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> for large federal capital 
	projects. All infrastructure projects creating an asset with a lifespan of at least 20 years, and having capital costs 
	of $100 million or more, will be subjected to a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen to determine whether a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> may be a suitable procurement option. 
	Should the assessment conclude that there is <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> potential, the procuring department will be required to develop a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> 
	proposal among possible procurement options.</p><p>Departments will also be encouraged to explore the potential of <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> approaches for other types of projects and procurements 
	of services.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, it is mandatory that departments and agencies assess planned infrastructure projects that have an estimated 
capital cost of at least $100 million and a lifespan of at least 20 years through a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen to determine whether a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> 
delivery model should be included as an option for further consideration through the planning process. Furthermore, Budget 
2011 encourages federal organizations to explore potential <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> opportunities through a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen for infrastructure projects 
that have capital costs of less than $100 million and a lifespan of less than 20 years. Budget 2011 also encourages federal 
organizations to explore <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> opportunities for investments other than federal infrastructure projects.</p><p>Before using a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen, or undertaking any analysis of options, departments and agencies should ensure that the organizational 
needs have been clearly defined. Needs analysis and a preliminary options analysis are also to be included as part of the 
business case. The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's (Secretariat's) <em><a href="/emf-cag/business-rentabilisation/bcg-gar/bcg-gar00-eng.asp">Business Case Guide</a></em> contains guidance for 
departments and agencies on defining needs and developing the strategic context for potential investment. It also provides 
guidance on conducting a preliminary options analysis. In addition, the <em><a href="/rpm-gbi/doc/gmrp-ggbi/gmrp-ggbi-eng.aspx">Guide to the Management of Real Property</a></em> has considerations 
for departments and agencies in planning for real property acquisition decision.</p><p>The <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen forms a part of this early process of narrowing the options. Once the requirement has been defined, organizations 
can determine whether a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is a viable option for further consideration. It is important to screen early to ensure that 
the activities through the planning process are appropriate. In the context of this guide, <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s are viewed as having four 
stages: 1) initial planning and identification, 2) project definition, 3) project implementation, and 4) project close-out. 
The appendix provides an example of potential activities in the planning process for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s. The <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen takes place in the 
initial planning and identification project stage as part of departmental preplanning activities.</p><section anchor="5.1" title="P3 Screening"><p>PPP Canada is developing a federal screen for departments and agencies. These organizations are required to consult PPP 
Canada in screening projects for their <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> potential. </p><p>The <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen consists of a series of questions that help determine whether the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is a viable option for further consideration. 
Considerations that are explored further through the questions in the screen include, but are not limited to, the following:
</p><p><strong>Private Sector Interest and Capacity:</strong> It is important to determine as early as possible whether there will be 
private sector interest in the potential investment because the value proposition of a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is enhanced by competition. Requests 
for expressions of interest and other forms of market sounding are often used as tools to assess market interest. Private 
sector interest is a primary driver in the ability of the model to deliver value; the level of interest depends on a variety 
of factors including the considerations outlined in this section. </p><p><strong>Asset Characteristics and Size:</strong> Assets with certain characteristics can be better suited for a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> model. For example:</p><ul><li>Larger investments tend to be better candidates for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s because they are more attractive to potential bidders; bundling 
	a number of assets may create a more attractive option for potential bidders. </li><li>New construction projects tend to be better candidates than refurbishments. </li><li>Anticipated ownership of the land may have an impact on the competitive bidding process and should be considered. 
	If the land in question is not owned by the government, potential bidders may be unable or unwilling to acquire it.
	</li></ul><p>Departments and agencies may wish to identify and analyze <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> experience based on similar classes of assets, both within 
Canada and internationally. This may help determine whether the characteristics of the particular asset may or may not lend 
themselves to the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> model.</p><p><strong>Time Horizon:</strong> Investments with a clear long-term requirement are better candidates for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s.</p><p><strong>Public Acceptance or Interest:</strong> It is important to consider the interest of the public in a potential <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> early 
on. Departments and agencies should identify potentially sensitive issues and their impacts to help determine whether there 
are any barriers to pursuing a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>. </p><p><strong>Opportunity to Transfer Risk:</strong> The potential value of a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> delivery model is heavily dependent on the ability to 
identify and allocate risks. While a full risk assessment will be undertaken as part of the value for money analysis, departments 
and agencies are encouraged to conduct a preliminary review of potential risks as part of the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen. It will be helpful 
to assess whether there may be opportunities to transfer these risks to the private sector and to determine the extent to 
which the investment will benefit from the transfer of risks. Risks that the private sector may be in a better position 
to manage include, for example, those related to design, construction, recapitalization, and timeline. The public sector 
is often in the best position to manage demand-related risks. </p><p><strong>Performance specifications:</strong> The ability to develop output specifications and performance requirements for the 
project is critical to the success of a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>. Evaluating <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> experience based on similar assets or asset classes may help the 
organization determine the feasibility of developing output specifications. </p><p><strong>Innovation:</strong> The potential for innovative solutions is an important consideration for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s. By coupling responsibility 
for infrastructure design with long-term operation and maintenance, the private sector may be able to add value to the planned 
investment. This added value may come in the form of cost savings, quicker implementation, new technology or other non-monetary 
benefits. Early consideration should be given to the possible innovation that the private sector may be able to offer. As 
a starting point, departments and agencies could identify whether innovation has been an important feature of <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s for similar 
asset classes. </p><p>The screen is used to determine whether a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is to be included as a viable option for further consideration. If it is 
determined through the screen that a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is a viable delivery option, departments and agencies will incorporate this <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> as 
an option in the value for money analysis and other planning activities. If it is determined through the screen that a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> 
is not a viable delivery option, departments and agencies will not incorporate this <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> as a delivery option in the remaining 
planning activities. </p><p>Once it has been determined that a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is a viable option, departments and agencies may wish to consider other factors, 
including the following. </p><p><strong>Organizational Capacity:</strong> The complexity and multidisciplinary requirements of <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s carry unique organizational 
demands. Departments and agencies should consider whether internal organizational capacity exists to carry out the project, 
the long-term implications of managing the resulting asset, and whether any gaps in capacity need to be filled. Given the 
complexity of the planning process, departments are encouraged to assess these capacity considerations early on. </p><p><strong>Financial or Funding Considerations:</strong><abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s have unique financial considerations. With traditional forms of delivery, 
payments are usually made during construction or upon completion of the asset. By contrast, <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s typically involve public 
sector payments in instalments over the life of the contract, with penalties or inducements relating to performance. It 
is important to consider the unique payment structure of <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s in the context of organizational budgets.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Value for Money"><section anchor="6.1" title="6.1 Policy Considerations"><p>In the Government of Canada, <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s are governed by various Treasury Board policies and their associated standards and directives. 
Policies governing federal investments in assets and acquired services primarily reside under the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12022">Policy Framework for the Management of Assets and Acquired Services</a></em>. Ensuring 
value for money in the management of assets and acquired services is a guiding principle of the framework and its associated 
policy instruments. </p><p>Deputy heads are accountable for ensuring that proper due diligence is conducted and that investment decisions demonstrate 
value for money in line with the principles outlined in Treasury Board policies. </p><p>The following is a summary of relevant Treasury Board policy considerations for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s: </p><ul><li>Under the <em>Policy Framework for the Management of Assets and Acquired Services</em>, value for money and sound 
	stewardship are achieved through a life-cycle approach to the management of assets and acquired services. </li><li>For decisions involving federal real property, departments and agencies may consult the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy on Management of Real Property</a></em>. The <em>Guide to the Management of 
	Real Property</em> provides guidance to departments and agencies on real property decisions throughout the property's 
	life cycle.</li><li>Federal investments should be considered in the context of the department's investment planning process. The objective 
	of the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18225">Policy on Investment Planning</a></em> is to contribute to the achievement 
	of value for money and sound stewardship in government program delivery through effective investment planning.</li><li>Federal real property projects are subject to the requirements of the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18229">Policy 
	on the Management of Projects</a></em>. The objective of the policy is to ensure that the appropriate systems, processes, 
	and controls for managing projects are in place at a departmental, horizontal, or government-wide level and that they 
	support the achievement of project and program outcomes, while limiting the risk to stakeholders and taxpayers. </li><li>Departments and agencies may consult the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494">Contracting Policy</a></em> and 
	associated policy instruments for contracting and procurement considerations. </li></ul><p>Once a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> has been identified as a potential delivery model for further consideration through the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen, value for 
money will be the determining factor for selecting the preferred option. The following sections outline some considerations 
for federal organizations in conducting a value for money analysis. </p></section><section anchor="6.2" title="6.2 Value for Money Analysis and the Development of the Business Case"><p>Value for money analysis essentially represents a risk-adjusted comparison of the costs and benefits of different investment 
options. While the distinction between value for money analysis and the development of the business case varies, for the 
purpose of this guide, value for money analysis is seen as an input into the development of the business case. The business 
case combines the analysis of requirements and screening with a preliminary value for money analysis that includes qualitative, 
quantitative, and risk factors. </p><p>The Secretariat's <em>Business Case Guide</em> provides departments and agencies with general guidance on developing business 
cases for federal projects. This includes guidance on financial, non-financial and risk considerations. However, the process 
of evaluating the value for money of <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s will likely carry unique considerations. Industry standards and best practices 
have evolved in the development of the value-for-money analysis process for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s. </p></section><section anchor="6.3" title="6.3 Introduction to the Value-for-Money Analysis Process"><p>Value for money analysis is an iterative process that takes place throughout the initial planning and identification 
and project definition stages of the planning process for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> projects. The table in the appendix provides an example of 
how this analysis may fit in the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> planning process. </p><p>The table identifies three points where the value for money analysis should be performed:</p><ol><li>A <strong>preliminary value for money analysis</strong> is conducted in the initial planning and identification stage. In 
	the preliminary value for money analysis, the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> option is compared with a range of other potentially feasible options, 
	and a preferred model is identified.</li><li>The value for money analysis is updated throughout the definition stage as variables and assumptions are further 
	refined. The <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> is compared with a public sector option to ensure that the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> remains the preferred option. </li><li>Once definition activities have been completed, the <strong>updated value for money analysis</strong> is concluded before 
	proceeding with the competitive process.</li><li>A final value for money assessment is conducted after bids have been received. </li></ol><p>It is important that the analysis is updated as information becomes available and assumptions are refined. Certain relevant 
assumptions in particular are continually evolving. Financial assumptions such as construction costs and the cost of debt 
evolve continually. </p><p>In the value for money analysis, the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> option is compared with a public sector delivery model option to help identify 

the potential value of the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> model. In this approach, the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> option is often referred to as the "shadow bid," while the 
public sector option is called the "public sector comparator." The public sector comparator is often a Design-Bid-Build 
delivery model where the public sector is responsible for design, financing, operations, and maintenance and the private 
sector is simply responsible for construction. Note that while it is common for value for money analysis to compare one 
shadow bid model with a public sector comparator model, it is also possible to assess and evaluate other options, including 
variations of the public sector comparator or the shadow bid.</p><p>At the time this guideline was issued, PPP Canada was developing a framework to assist federal organizations in assessing 
value for money. Departments and agencies are encouraged to contact PPP Canada for advice and guidance on the value-for-money 
analysis process for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s. </p></section><section anchor="6.4" title="6.4 Content of the Value for Money Analysis"><p>The value-for-money analysis process generally entails the following components:</p><ul><li>An analysis of the non-financial implications of each option. </li><li>An analysis of risks associated with each option.</li><li>An analysis of the financial implications of the selected options. This will also include a risk-adjusted financial 
	calculation.</li></ul><p>Some investment analysis models examine non-financial factors outside the value for money analysis and include these 
factors as part of a broader options analysis. This guide includes the non-financial analysis as a component of the value 
for money analysis, because value for money is seen to be derived from both financial and non-financial factors. In all 
cases, however, the non-financial, risk and financial analyses determine whether a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> model delivers best value for the 
Crown. </p><h4>Analysis of Non-financial Implications</h4><p>Non-financial or qualitative analysis involves the evaluation of the non-financial factors of an investment decision. 
These factors will have been examined as part of the preliminary value for money analysis, but may be further refined as 
new information becomes available. </p><p>Analysis of non-financial factors may involve different activities. The Secretariat's <em>Business Case Guide</em> can 
provide guidance on certain non-financial considerations, such as strategic alignment, cost-benefit analysis and impact 
analysis. </p><p>This type of analysis usually includes a description of the qualitative issues inherent in different delivery models 
as well as formalized ratings of each delivery model along a set of qualitative criteria. Weightings can also be given for 
each of the qualitative criteria based on their perceived relative importance. Options can be assessed in a workshop setting, 
which may help reduce subjective biases.</p><p>The type of criteria used to evaluate the range of delivery options may depend on the nature of the investment and the 
departmental context. Criteria may align with the considerations used in the initial <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screen, or additional criteria may 
be incorporated. It is important to formally document the rationale for any differences in ratings between options. Examples 
of types of qualitative criteria include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Project and Program-Related Criteria: </strong>These have to do with the ability of each delivery model to meet specific 
	project-related requirements, such as timing, the size of the project, its characteristics, innovation and risk allocation, 
	and other program-related criteria. </li><li><strong>Government of Canada Objectives and Public Considerations:</strong> These have to do with the ability of the project 
	to meet Government of Canada objectives. The analysis may include:<ul><li>Policy and legislative requirements, such as environmental or legal issues; </li><li>Potential impact on the general public including the anticipated level of public interest and attention the 
		investment is expected to receive; and </li><li>Other potentially sensitive issues. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Private Sector Considerations:</strong> These include such factors as the likelihood of private sector interest, level 
	of experience, and the capacity of private sector organizations.</li></ul><p>It may be helpful to examine the organizational capacity considerations of each option. </p><p>It is important to ensure that the various non-financial benefits of each option are articulated clearly and concisely 
through the analysis. Departments and agencies may wish to determine whether the non-financial benefits of each delivery 
option can be measured. This may help in conveying the relative costs and benefits of each option. </p><h4>Analysis of Risks </h4><p>There are two ways that risk can be examined in the context of an investment analysis involving <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s:</p><ul><li><strong>Risk management: </strong>This involves examining the risk implications associated with each delivery option and identifying 
	the most appropriate course of action.</li><li><strong>Risk-adjusted financial analysis:</strong> This involves adjusting the cash flows of each option in the financial 
	analysis to account for risk. </li></ul><p>Considerations for the risk management process are outlined here. Risk-adjusted financial analysis is examined under 
Financial Analysis. </p><p>The principles of risk management are set out in the Treasury Board's <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=19422">Framework 
for the Management of Risk</a></em>. In this framework, risk management is defined as a systematic approach to setting the 
best course of action under uncertainty by identifying, assessing, understanding, making decisions on and communicating 
risk issues. </p><p>Analysis of the risk considerations of each delivery option is a critical component of the investment analysis process. 
The <em>Business Case Guide</em> outlines considerations for the management of risks. It identifies four common risk management 
functions:</p><ul><li>Risk identification </li><li>Risk assessment (including measuring likelihood and impact) </li><li>Risk response </li><li>Monitoring and evaluation</li></ul><p>Assessing the cost of each risk option is another important step in the risk management process, particularly for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s. 
Potential <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> risks are usually identified and assessed in workshop settings that involve subject-matter experts, including 
external consultants such as quantity surveyors, engineers, and facility planners. Risk management considerations are typically 
summarized in a risk register. </p><p>A risk register is developed as part of the preliminary value for money analysis. The register identifies the risks and 
indicates the probability of their occurrence and their impact. It also identifies the best course of action in light of 
these considerations. This may include retaining the risks or transferring them to the private sector, depending on the 
ability of each party (public or private) to manage the risks. </p><p>Once the risks have been identified, their likelihood and potential impact assessed, and the responses proposed, the 
cost of the risks can then be assessed. A number of methods can be used to value risk. The overall analysis is aimed at 
estimating the cost of allocating risk under different scenarios and, ultimately, at estimating the risk-adjusted cost of 
each option to the public sector.</p><p>As new information becomes available, the risk analysis may need to be updated. Additional considerations may arise from 
cost consultants, through collaborative dialogue or in updating assumptions in other activities. Specifically, in the later 
stages it may be important to define more precisely which risks should be retained by the public sector and which risks 
will be transferred to the private sector. This may result from changes in the projected costs of transferring risks to 
the private partner.</p><p>Risk management in the context of a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> does not involve transferring all project-related risks to the private sector. 
The goal of optimal risk allocation is to distribute risks to the party that is best able to manage them. The rationale 
for the decision to retain or transfer risks should be clear and formally documented. This decision will depend in large 
part on the cost associated with transferring particular risks. The cost of risks transferred to the private partner will 
depend on assumptions of a private partner's ability to manage them and may involve the use of advisory services. </p><h4>Financial Analysis</h4><p>The value for money analysis includes a systematic comparison of the financial benefits and the costs of each delivery 
model over the investment horizon. </p><p>The financial analysis process for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s involves estimating financial assumptions that are then incorporated into a financial 
model or investment tool. The steps involved will vary depending on the particular model employed. The Government of Canada 
does not prescribe one investment model or tool. The Secretariat's <em>Business Case Guide</em> and <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12251">Guide to Costing</a></em> can provide some general guidance on costing for federal initiatives; 
however, financial analysis and modelling for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s will carry unique considerations, primarily as a result of the relationship 
with the private partner and the process of comparing the <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> option with the public sector comparator. </p><p>Given the complexity of financial analysis involving <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s, it is important to ensure a good understanding of the model 
used so that it will fairly and accurately represent the financial considerations of each delivery option. </p><p>Financial analysis for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s typically considers the time value of money and employs a discounted cash flow methodology. 
The discounted cash flow analysis for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s examines financial considerations at all stages of the life cycle and reflects 
all relevant costs and benefits to the government as a whole. Generally, the options are evaluated using a net present value 
calculation; however, there are other financial measures to help determine the relative value of each of the examined options.
</p><p>With the discounted cash flow methodology, all cash flows are discounted to their present value using the standard discount 
rate established by the organization. The discount rate is the rate at which the cash flows occurring at different times 
in the future are brought to a base period, usually the present day. </p><p>The discount rate used as part of the financial model will have a significant influence on the relative net present value 
of each model because it affects all cash flows. A higher rate will typically favour the shadow bid over the public sector 
comparator and, conversely, a lower rate will favour the public sector comparator over the shadow bid. </p><p>Different jurisdictions use different methodologies for determining the appropriate discount rate. These range from using 
the public sector's long-term rate of borrowing to using the project's internal rate of return, based on assumed inputs 
derived from similar projects. The Government of Canada does not currently prescribe a particular discount rate for federal 
projects; however, using a rate linked to the long-term Government of Canada borrowing rate is a common practice. Federal 
organizations are encouraged to ensure that the discount rate employed is considered in the broader context of the financial 
model and that the justification for the particular discount rate is formally documented. </p><p><strong>Risk-adjusted financial analysis</strong> is a feature of investment analysis for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s. Through this process, the cash flows 
of each option are adjusted to account for risk. This will result in a risk-adjusted financial calculation that is typically 
a risk-adjusted net present value. The risk-adjusted financial results will ultimately depend on the nature of the risks 
that are allocated between the public sector and the private partner, the probability that they will occur, and the corresponding 
costs.</p><p>Many variables may not be known at the early stages of the planning process, and assumptions will need to be developed. 
For example, because <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s are usually financed by the private sector, there are additional economic and market factors that 
need to be considered. These variables are not static, and it is important that they be regularly reviewed to ensure they 
remain current. Many revenue and costing assumptions may be consistent across the options, particularly at the early stages 
of the planning process. It is important to ensure that all assumptions are formally documented and have a clear rationale 
for their selection, particularly where there are notable differences between the options. </p><p>Due to the potential for greater uncertainty around <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> financial assumptions, it is important to formally assess and 
document those areas where the model employed is sensitive to particular variables. A sensitivity analysis is often conducted 
as part of an investment analysis, and there are different methods for conducting this analysis. </p><p>Sensitivity analysis essentially examines how changes to financial assumptions affect the results of the analysis. Small 
changes in certain variables could result in large changes to the net present value and may ultimately alter the relative 
ranking of the options. For example, the net present value is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate because 
it is used to discount all of the cash flows in the financial analysis. It is especially important for federal organizations 
to monitor and validate assumptions as the project progresses and there is greater certainty.</p></section><section anchor="6.5" title="6.5 Advisory Services"><p>Because of certain unique and complex features of the value for money analysis for <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s, a variety of advisory services 
may be used through the process. In addition to consulting with PPP Canada, departments and agencies may require the following 
resources:</p><ul><li><strong>Financial Advisors:</strong> Financial advisors typically provide capital market assessment (if needed), financial 
	model development, advice on risk analysis, and review of bidders' models; they can also assist in the commercial and 
	financial closing of the project.</li><li><strong>Facilities Management / Output Specification Advisors:</strong> These technical advisors assist in the development 
	of the output requirements and the standards for the asset. </li><li><strong>Cost Consultants or Design Consultants:</strong> These consultants provide assistance in assessing the costs of designing 
	and building the asset. They can also provide cost data for the risk workshops. </li></ul><p>Other advisors may be used throughout the planning process, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Transaction Advisors:</strong> These advisors provide support for the competitive process, contributing to the development 
	of documentation such as the request for qualifications, the request for proposals and the project agreement. A fairness 
	monitor may also be used as part of the competitive process.</li><li><strong>Legal Advisors:</strong> Legal advisors can identify potential legal or legislative hurdles in the early stages of 
	the project and provide solutions for addressing them. They can also help draft and review legal documentation throughout 
	the later stages of the planning process.</li></ul></section><section anchor="6.6" title="6.6 Treasury Board Approvals"><p>A variety of Treasury Board approvals may be required for a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>, including project approval, expenditure authority, contract 
approval, and the authority to enter into a real property transaction. These approvals are to be requested through Treasury 
Board submissions. Departments and agencies are encouraged to consult the Secretariat early in the planning process to identify 
the approvals required at various stages of the process. <em><a href="/pubs_pol/opepubs/tbm_162/gptbs-gppct-eng.asp">A Guide 
to Preparing Treasury Board Submissions</a></em> outlines further considerations and guidance on approval requirements.
</p><p>It should be noted that, in the process of reviewing Treasury Board submissions, the Secretariat monitors policy compliance 
and may request information from departments and agencies accordingly. This would include a request for information on the 
value for money analysis and <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> screening activities. </p></section><section anchor="6.7" title="6.7 General Considerations"><p><abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s can involve more up-front planning than traditional delivery models. It is important to ensure that the value for 
money analysis begins as early as possible in the planning stages, once input variables are known and assumptions can be 
developed. In addition, certain financial (e.g., borrowing and construction costs) and non-financial (e.g., political) considerations 
may change in the course of the planning process. It is important to update analyses regularly so that they remain current 
and to observe the effect of changes in assumptions on the relative rating of a particular approach.</p><p>Throughout the investment analysis process, it is critical that the options are assessed objectively and are free from 
bias. The purpose of the analysis is to present an objective examination of each potential delivery option, and not to defend 
a pre-selected option. It may be helpful to document the significant factors in the non-financial, risk and financial analyses 
that most substantially contributed to the identification of the preferred option. Identification of key contributing factors 
in the analysis may help decision makers throughout the approval process.</p><p>It may also be helpful to draw from the experience of other jurisdictions. While Canadian experience using <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s at the 
federal level is limited to a few recent examples, there are other jurisdictions internationally (e.g., Great Britain and 
Australia) and within Canada (e.g., Ontario and British Columbia) that have more extensive experience using this model. 
Departments and agencies may want to identify experience based on similar asset classes and determine the lessons learned 
from these projects.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Enquiries"><p>For general information on this guideline or for information about Treasury Board policy and approval requirements, departments
