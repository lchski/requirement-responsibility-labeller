Effective date"><p>1.1 This directive takes effect on October 1, 2008. </p><p>1.2 The transitional considerations outlined in section 1.2 of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a> apply to this 
directive.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 This directive applies to departments that are subject to the <em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 This directive is to be read in conjunction with the <em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em>.</p><p>3.2 The directive supports the objectives of the <em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em> by providing operational requirements 
for departmental managers who have been assigned responsibilities for the management of transfer payments.</p><p>3.3 The directive provides for the tailoring of certain general requirements to reflect relationships with specific categories 
of recipients. In particular:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The requirements relating to transfer payments to other orders of government in Canada 
are designed to respect the unique nature of federalism and government-to-government relations, and the jurisdiction and 
responsibilities of each order of government;</li><li>The requirements relating to transfer payments to foreign recipients take into account 
that these recipients are not subject to Canadian law and may have well-established accountability structures; and</li><li>The requirements relating to transfer payments to Aboriginal recipients, given the wide 
range and long-term nature of many programs offered, are designed to promote collaboration among departments and provide 
for additional funding options. </li></ol><p>3.4 The requirements of the directive provide for accountability, transparency and effective control in the management 
of transfer payments. The requirements also provide flexibility to adapt the administrative requirements on applicants and 
recipients to the risks involved. The directive allows departments to develop a measured response to risk throughout the 
management cycle of transfer payments, reflected in the selection of the appropriate transfer payment instruments, in the 
extent of funding agreement requirements, in cash management practices, in reporting requirements and in the monitoring 
and auditing of recipients.</p><p>3.5 This directive is issued under subsection 7(1) of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/f-11/270969.html"><em>Financial 
Administration Act</em></a>.</p><p>3.6 The Treasury Board has delegated authority to the President of the Treasury Board to issue this directive in support 
of the <em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em>, to amend or rescind the directive and to approve any exceptions to the directive 
that may be sought.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.

Directive statement"><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 Objective"><p>The objective of this directive is to achieve effective, risk-based approaches to the design and delivery of transfer 
payment programs and to ensure accountability and value for money for transfer payments.</p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Expected results"><p>The expected results of this directive are that: </p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Risk-based approaches are adopted to the design of transfer payment programs, the preparation 
of terms and conditions and funding agreements, and recipient monitoring and auditing; </li><li>Harmonization of transfer payment programs is facilitated to the extent possible and 
administrative processes and procedures for the delivery of transfer payments are standardized within departments and among 
departments; and</li><li>The unique circumstances in making transfer payments to other orders of government, 
foreign recipients and Aboriginal recipients are taken into account.</li></ol></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Requirements"><p>Departmental managers who have been assigned responsibilities for the management of transfer payment programs and transfer

These Aboriginal peoples have unique heritages, cultural practices and spiritual beliefs. Indians (now generally known as First Nation) are descendants from the various tribes that occupied what is now Canada prior to the arrival of Europeans. As a result of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/I-5/"><em>Indian Act</em></a>, First Nation people may be referred to as status or non-status Indians. Indians who are beneficiaries under a treaty may be referred to as treaty Indians.  Inuit are descendants of the original inhabitants of Northern Canada including what is now known as Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Northern Quebec and Northern Labrador.

to assess the following elements and document evidence of their consideration. </strong></p><ol><li>The objectives and expected outcomes, with linkages to the department's Program Alignment 
  Architecture and related strategic outcomes.</li><li>When applicable, the manner in which the redesign of the transfer payment program addresses 
  the results of an evaluation or review of relevancy and effectiveness.</li><li>The feasibility of harmonizing (aligning or integrating) the program being created or 
  redesigned, with other transfer payment programs within the department and, to the extent possible, with other departments.</li><li>Whether a horizontal transfer payment program involving other departments is required 
  and, if so, whether legislative and spending authorities are appropriate and whether umbrella terms and conditions or complementary 
  terms and conditions should be prepared. </li><li>The identification of eligible recipients or category of recipients, the nature and 
  type of initiatives that will be considered eligible under the transfer payment program, and the method to be used to determine 
  the amount a recipient will be eligible to receive under the transfer payment program. </li><li>A plan for the engagement of potential recipients and other interested parties, where 
  deemed appropriate.</li><li>The performance measurement strategy for ongoing performance management of the transfer 
  payment program, including the performance measures and indicators and the supporting data requirements and data collection 
  strategy. </li><li>The risks specific to the transfer payment program, the potential risks associated with 
  applicants and recipients, and the measures that will be used to manage these risks.</li><li>The rationale used in the selection of the appropriate transfer payment instruments 
  taking into account the characteristics of the various instruments relative to the public policy issue to be addressed, 
  the specific program objective or outcome, the level of funding, the type of recipients, and the nature and level of risks. 
  In particular the following should be considered:<ul><li>Grants are appropriate when the amount of funding to be provided can be determined 
  in advance and eligibility criteria and information obtained before payment provide assurance that the grant will be used 
  for the purpose for which it is provided. Grants are not appropriate where funding provided to a recipient is to be further 
  distributed to one or more persons or entities.</li><li>Contributions are appropriate when the department deems it necessary to monitor 
  progress and results, receive an accounting of the use of funds from the recipient, and have the right to carry out a recipient 
  audit or to request some other type of certification or audit assurance from the recipient.</li><li>A transfer payment that provides up-front multi-year funding is usually only 
appropriate where the demonstrated financial stability of the recipient is a necessary condition for the recipient to meet 
objectives involving the implementation of longer-term plans, undertaking multi-year commitments or matching leveraged funding 
from the public and private sectors. </li><li>Endowment funding may be appropriate when there is an intention or requirement 
to fund a recipient on a long-term basis and the recipient has the capacity to manage invested funds. When endowment funding 
is appropriate, the selection of the transfer payment instrument to make the payment is important. A grant may be most appropriate 
where sufficient assurance is available at the time of providing the endowment that the funding will be used for the purposes 
for which it is provided and where no accounting for the use of the funding is deemed necessary. Where ongoing monitoring 
and reporting on the use of the funds provided is required, endowment funding should be provided on the same basis as other 
up-front multi-year funding.</li></ul></li><li>The opportunity to use the additional contribution funding approaches for transfer payments to Aboriginal recipients, 
as described in <a href="#appK">Appendix K: Transfer Payments to Aboriginal Recipients</a>.</li><li>Where the transfer payment program provides for contributions that are wholly or partially repayable, the conditions 
that determine the amount and timing of repayment.</li><li>The administrative requirements on applicants and recipients and a strategy to ensure these are no more than 
is needed to meet the department's control, transparency and accountability requirements.</li><li>Where contributions are to be used, the basis on which contribution final payments and any progress payments 
are to be made, which is to be one or a combination of the following: <ul><li>achievement of pre-determined performance expectations or milestones;</li><li>reimbursement of eligible expenditures;</li><li>a costing formula; or</li><li>a predetermined annual amount when the fixed and block contribution funding 
approaches for transfer payments to Aboriginal recipients are used. This may also be applicable when the flexible contribution 
approach for transfer payments to Aboriginal recipients is used.</li></ul>
The choice of approach should reflect the risk associated with the transfer payment program and the known capacities 
of the recipients. </li><li>The basis for a stacking limit, in accordance with <a href="#appC">Appendix C: Total Canadian Government 
Funding and Stacking Limits</a>.</li><li>The feasibility of standardizing the processes, systems and procedures to be used in delivering the transfer 
payment program being designed or redesigned with those that support existing transfer payment programs within the department 
and, to the extent possible, with those of other departments.</li><li>The feasibility of using applicant and recipient information already available to departments to facilitate 
access to the transfer payment program and reduce the administrative requirements imposed on recipients, while respecting 
all federal legislative requirements, including the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</li><li>The implications for the transfer payment program of obligations undertaken by Canada as a signatory to international 
multilateral agreements aimed at preventing inappropriate trade barriers, and a demonstration that these obligations have 
been respected. </li><li>The sustainable development implications of the transfer payment program.</li><li>Whether a payment under the proposed transfer payment program would trigger any obligation under the <em>Canadian 
  Environmental Assessment Act</em>.</li><li>Whether there is a need to establish any rights to the use of intellectual property created by recipients through 
their use of transfer payments and, if so, the basis for establishing such rights. </li><li>Where goods, services or assets are to be transferred under a transfer payment program, the spending authority 
for such transfers based on specific vote wording in an appropriation act. </li><li>The manner in which the obligations of the Government of Canada set out in the <em>Official Languages Act</em> 
are to be taken into account and, where relevant, applied in designing the transfer payment program.</li></ol></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C: Total Canadian Government Funding and Stacking Limits"><ol><li>Departmental managers are responsible for establishing a stacking limit in the terms 
and conditions for a transfer payment program, setting the maximum permitted level of total Canadian government funding 
under that program for any one activity, initiative or project of a recipient. A stacking limit is to be expressed either 
as a percentage of the total eligible expenditures, or as a percentage of total expenditures, of an activity, initiative 
or project to be funded, whichever is most appropriate for the transfer payment program design. </li><li>Departmental managers are to take into account the following types of federal, provincial, 
territorial and municipal funding toward the same project in calculating total Canadian government funding for any one initiative 
or project of a recipient:  <ul><li>all grants and contributions being considered and all other grants and contributions 
for which the applicant is eligible;</li><li>all new investment in the recipient's business in the form of capital stock 
or equity from a Crown corporation or government department or agency, in the proportion the new investment bears to the 
total investment being made; </li><li>implicit subsidies, including low-interest or interest-free loans, based 
on the difference between the total interest payable and the total interest that would be payable at normal commercial interest 
rates;</li><li>rebates, including interest cost rebates, triggered by the supported project;</li><li>forgivable loans;</li><li>provisions for potential losses on loan guarantees and loans, where such 
guarantees or loans are issued by governments, ministers or agencies created for the purpose of administering programs, 
except when the assistance is provided by a Crown corporation whose principal function is of a banking nature. This provision 
will be set initially at 5 per cent of the amount guaranteed or such other amount as is based on program experience; and</li><li>investment tax credits to which the applicant would be entitled.</li></ul></li></ol></appendix><appendix anchor="D" title="Appendix D: Terms and Conditions for Grants"><p class="indent1"><strong>Departmental managers responsible for preparing terms and conditions are to ensure that the following mandatory

funding agreement provided that the obligations and objectives set out in the funding agreement are met and the recipient 
agrees to use the unexpended funding for purposes consistent with the program objectives or any other purpose agreed to 
by the department.</li></ul></li><li>Flexible contribution funding should be considered when:<ul><li>the achievement of the objectives of the transfer payment program is expected 
to require a two or more year relationship with the recipient and a commensurate multi-year funding agreement is appropriate;</li><li>the program objectives can be better achieved by providing the recipient 
with flexibility to redirect funding among the cost categories established in the agreement; and</li><li>the stability of the relationship with the recipient is reflected and strengthened 
by allowing the recipient, during the period of the funding agreement, to retain unexpended funding remaining at the end 
of each fiscal year for use in the next fiscal year to further achieve results toward the program objectives. Any unexpended 
funding remaining at the expiry of the funding agreement constitutes a debt due to the Crown. </li></ul></li><li>Block contribution funding should be considered when:<ul><li>the recipient is to receive funding for a number of transfer payments programs

multi-program objectives is appropriate to cover funding for all of the transfer payment programs in the block;</li><li>the various program objectives and the recipient's priorities can be better 
achieved by providing the recipient the flexibility to adjust the relative priority of programs in the block and to redirect 
funding among the programs to address changing circumstances and the recipient's evolving priorities, provided progress 
toward the program objectives is being achieved;</li><li>the funding for the programs in the block can be determined on an annual

for purposes consistent with the multi-program objectives or any other purpose reflecting the priorities of the recipient 
and agreed to by the departments; and</li><li>annual reporting on costs incurred and results achieved is sufficient.</li></ul></li><li>Flexible and block contribution funding are only to be used for transfer payments to 
Aboriginal recipients when the recipient has the demonstrated capacity to manage transfer payments. In assessing this, departmental 
managers are to take into account the recipient's:<ul><li>governance structure;</li><li>organization for purposes of program management, financial and administrative
