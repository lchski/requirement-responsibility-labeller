Project approval provides authorization to seek expenditure authority, but does  not in and of itself convey authority to expend funds on the project. A request  for project approval follows completion of the business case and must be  supported by an indicative cost estimate. </p><p>Expenditure authority provides the  authority to expend funds against those activities for which the authority was  sought. Expenditure authority granted by Treasury Board indicates that  sufficient information is available, at an appropriate level of detail, to  proceed with a particular phase or phases of the project. A request for expenditure  authority must be supported by a substantive cost estimate. </p><p>Prior to receiving project approval and expenditure authority from Treasury Board, the responsible ministers' authority is limited to those activities necessary  to seek the initial project approval and expenditure authority such as options  analysis, feasibility studies, socio-economic studies, technical  investigations, market analysis, topographic surveys, and pricing and  availability studies. 
    These activities are commonly referred to as  pre-definition activities. </p><p>Once granted, project approval and expenditure authority will establish an agreed  upon project baseline. </p><p>Amended  authority in terms of project approval and /or expenditure authority must be  sought from Treasury Board when:</p><ul><li>The total estimated cost changes such that it exceeds expenditure limits (expenditure authority) approved by Treasury Board; or</li><li>There is a significant change to the anticipated outcomes and benefits identified at time of approval; or</li><li>There has been a significant change to the project baseline established at time of approval.</li></ul><p>When it is clear that one or more of the above conditions will be realized, departments must initiate in a timely fashion, the process of seeking amended authorities. </p><p>Requests for project approval, expenditure authority, or amendments to the same must be supported by the following documentation:</p><p class="mrgn-lft-md">Appended to the submission</p><ul><li>Project brief (Appendix E)</li></ul><p class="mrgn-lft-md">Provided to TBS at the same time as the draft  submission </p><ul><li>Business case </li><li>Project Management Plan</li><li>Project Gating Plan </li><li>Procurement Plan</li><li>Appointment letter (where applicable)</li><li>Project charter</li></ul><p class="mrgn-lft-md">Other plans or documents may be requested by TBS as  and when required. </p><h3>Standard submission  approach</h3><p>Following the conclusion of the initial planning and  identification phase, the minister responsible for a project requiring the  approval authority of Treasury Board will seek project approval for the project  and expenditure authority for the definition phase. </p><p>Once the definition phase is completed, the minister responsible  for a project will seek expenditure authority for the implementation and close-out  phases of the project. </p><h3>Streamlined submission approach </h3><p>For projects assessed at a PCRA level 1 or 2 that  require Treasury Board approval, departments may be eligible to seek  authorities for the entire project through a single submission following the  conclusion of the initial planning and identification phase. The submission  will seek project approval for the project, expenditure authority for the  definition phase, and conditional expenditure authority for the implementation  and close-out phases. The project should also seek any required contracting  authorities at this time. </p><p>To be eligible for this approach, in addition to all  other submission requirements, the original submission and associated documents  must include a fulsome description of the overall gating approach over the  project life cycle and the monitoring and control regime that will be applied  to the project. In addition, the overall contingency (a measure of uncertainty)  may not exceed 20%.</p><p>Departments are to confirm with TBS the suitability of  this approach in advance of the preparation of the initial submission.</p><p>Following completion of the definition phase, the  department may proceed with the implementation, contracting and close-out  phases without returning to Treasury Board if the following conditions apply:</p><ul><li>The Chief Financial Officer confirms in writing to the responsible TBS Program Assistant Secretary, that the project remains within the cost baseline established through the original submission; and</li><li>The project sponsor confirms in writing to the responsible TBS Program Assistant Secretary, that there have been no significant changes to the project baseline or intended outcomes and benefits. </li></ul><h3>Associated authorities </h3><p>In cases where projects also include real property transactions and/or contracting activities which also require Treasury Board approval, departments are encouraged to coordinate all required approvals (project, real property and procurement) to provide a consolidated view to Treasury Board ministers and in doing so, minimize the number of submissions. </p></appendix><appendix anchor="E" title="Appendix E: Project Brief"><clauses><clause anchor="E.1">A project brief must provide Treasury Board, the  sponsoring minister, senior departmental officials, and TBS with a clear and  concise understanding of the proposed initiative.
