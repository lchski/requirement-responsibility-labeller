<div><em>Please note that the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049">Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</a>, 
tabled in Parliament on December 21, 2011 will be tabled in both Houses of Parliament for at 
least 30 days, before it comes into force.  In light of this parliamentary process, we aim to have the Code come into force on April 2, 2012. 
Once the Code is in force, all federal public sector employees will be required to adhere to the Code as a term and condition of employment. In the 
meantime, the <a href="/pubs_pol/hrpubs/tb_851/vec-cve-eng.asp">current Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service</a> is still in 
effect and will continue to support Public Service employees in their day-to-day work.</em><br /><br />

</notetoreader--><chapters><chapter anchor="1" title="The Role of Federal Public Servants"><p>Federal public servants have a fundamental role to play in serving Canadians, their communities and the public interest under the direction of the elected government and in accordance with the law. As professionals whose work is essential to Canada’s well-being and the enduring strength of the Canadian democracy, public servants uphold the public trust.</p><p>The Constitution of Canada and the principles of responsible government provide the foundation for the role, responsibilities and values of the federal public sector.<a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1" title="See footnote 1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Constitutional conventions of ministerial responsibility prescribe the appropriate relationships among ministers, parliamentarians, public servants<a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2" title="See footnote 2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and the public. A professional and non-partisan federal public sector is integral to our democracy.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="The Role of Ministers"><p>Ministers are also responsible for preserving public trust and confidence in the integrity of public sector organizations and for upholding the tradition and practice of a professional non-partisan federal public sector. Furthermore, ministers play a critical role in supporting public servants’ responsibility to provide professional and frank advice.<a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3" title="See footnote 3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Objectives"><p>This Code outlines the values and expected behaviours that guide public servants in all activities related to their professional duties. By committing to these values and adhering to the expected behaviours, public servants strengthen the ethical culture of the public sector and contribute to public confidence in the integrity of all public institutions.</p><p>As established by the Treasury Board, this Code fulfills the requirement of section 5 of the <em>Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act</em> (PSDPA). It was developed in consultation with public servants, public sector organizations and bargaining agents. This Code should be read in conjunction with organizational codes of conduct.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Statement of Values"><p>These values are a compass to guide public servants in everything they do. They cannot be considered in isolation from each other as they will often overlap. This Code and respective organizational codes of conduct are important sources of guidance for public servants. Organizations are expected to take steps to integrate these values into their decisions, actions, policies, processes, and systems. Similarly, public servants can expect to be treated in accordance with these values by their organization.</p><section anchor="4a" title="Respect for Democracy"><p>The system of Canadian parliamentary democracy and its institutions are fundamental to serving the public interest. Public servants recognize that elected officials are accountable to
Parliament, and ultimately to the Canadian people, and that a non-partisan public sector is essential to our democratic system.</p></section><section anchor="4b" title="Respect for People"><p>Treating all people with respect, dignity and fairness is fundamental to our relationship with the Canadian public and contributes to a safe and healthy work environment that promotes
engagement, openness and transparency. The diversity of our people and the ideas they generate are the source of our innovation.</p></section><section anchor="4c" title="Integrity"><p>Integrity is the cornerstone of good governance and democracy. By upholding the highest ethical standards, public servants conserve and enhance public confidence in the honesty, fairness and
impartiality of the federal public sector.</p></section><section anchor="4d" title="Stewardship"><p>Federal public servants are entrusted to use and care for public resources responsibly, for both the short term and long term.</p></section><section anchor="4e" title="Excellence"><p>Excellence in the design and delivery of public sector policy, programs and services is beneficial to every aspect of Canadian public life. Engagement, collaboration, effective teamwork and professional development are all essential to a high-performing organization.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Expected Behaviours"><p>Federal public servants are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the values of the public sector and these expected behaviours.</p><ol><li><strong>Respect For Democracy</strong><ul class="noBullet index"><li><em>Public servants shall uphold the Canadian parliamentary democracy and its institutions by:</em></li><li>1.1 Respecting the rule of law and carrying out their duties in accordance with legislation, policies and directives in a non-partisan and impartial manner.</li><li>1.2 Loyally carrying out the lawful decisions of their leaders and supporting ministers in their accountability to Parliament and Canadians.</li><li>1.3 Providing decision makers with all the information, analysis and advice they need, always striving to be open, candid and impartial.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Respect For People</strong><ul class="noBullet index"><li><em>Public servants shall respect human dignity and the value of every person by:</em></li><li>2.1 Treating every person with respect and fairness.</li><li>2.2 Valuing diversity and the benefit of combining the unique qualities and strengths inherent in a diverse workforce.</li><li>2.3 Helping to create and maintain safe and healthy workplaces that are free from harassment and discrimination.</li><li>2.4 Working together in a spirit of openness, honesty and transparency that encourages engagement, collaboration and respectful communication.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Integrity</strong><ul class="noBullet index"><li><em>Public servants shall serve the public interest by:</em></li><li>3.1 Acting at all times with integrity and in a manner that will bear the closest public scrutiny, an obligation that may not be fully satisfied by simply acting within the law.</li><li>3.2 Never using their official roles to inappropriately obtain an advantage for themselves or to advantage or disadvantage others.</li><li>3.3 Taking all possible steps to prevent and resolve any real, apparent or potential conflicts of interest between their official responsibilities and their private affairs in favour of the public interest.</li><li>3.4 Acting in such a way as to maintain their employer’s trust.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stewardship</strong><ul class="noBullet index"><li><em>Public servants shall use resources responsibly by:</em></li><li>4.1 Effectively and efficiently using the public money, property and resources managed by them.</li><li>4.2 Considering the present and long-term effects that their actions have on people and the environment.</li><li>4.3 Acquiring, preserving and sharing knowledge and information as appropriate.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Excellence</strong><ul class="noBullet index"><li><em>Public servants shall demonstrate professional excellence by:</em></li><li>5.1 Providing fair, timely, efficient and effective services that respect Canada’s official languages.</li><li>5.2 Continually improving the quality of policies, programs and services they provide.</li><li>5.3 Fostering a work environment that promotes teamwork, learning and innovation.</li></ul></li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="Application"><p>Acceptance of these values and adherence to the expected behaviours is a condition of employment for every public servant in the federal public sector, regardless of their level or position.
