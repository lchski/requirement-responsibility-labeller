Executive salaries need not be at the salary range maximum in order for executives to receive lump sum performance awards.</li><li>A prerequisite for access to lump sum performance awards is that at least most expectations for the achievement of Ongoing Commitments have been met (Level 2 and up). No lump sum performance award may be provided when the executive's assessment for Key Commitments was Level 0 or 1 (Unable to Assess or Did Not Meet).</li><li>In determining the amount of lump sum performance awards, the importance and impact of results achieved as well as how the results were achieved (demonstration of Key Leadership Competencies and values and ethics) are taken into consideration.</li><li>Lump sum performance awards, from zero up to the maximum, can be provided when an executive's performance is at least Level 2 (Met Most) in relation to the achievement of both Ongoing and Key Commitments.
