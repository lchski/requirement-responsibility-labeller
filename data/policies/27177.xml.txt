Effective date"><p>This guideline takes effect April 1, 2013.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Purpose"><p>The purpose of this Guideline is to assist departments in
implementing Canada's obligations with respect to the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> in accordance with the
Comprehensive Integrated Taxation Coordination Agreement (<abbr title="Comprehensive Integrated Taxation Coordination Agreement">CITCA</abbr>) and the Reciprocal
Taxation Agreement (<abbr title="Reciprocal Taxation Agreement">RTA</abbr>) between Canada and Quebec.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1
This guideline supports the requirements under sections 6.1 and 6.2 of
the <em>Directive on the Payment, Collection and Remittance of Provincial Taxes and Fees</em>
(the Directive).</p><p>3.2
On March 28, 2012, Canada and Quebec entered into a <abbr title="Comprehensive Integrated Taxation Coordination Agreement">CITCA</abbr>. As part of
the <abbr title="Comprehensive Integrated Taxation Coordination Agreement">CITCA</abbr>, Canada agreed to replace the current exemption mechanism from paying
<abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> applicable to federal government departments with a tax payment and rebate
mechanism starting April 1, 2013. In other words, the federal government
departments are now required to pay the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on their purchases of taxable
supplies when the applicable <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> is paid or payable after March 31, 2013</p><p>3.3
A statutory, non-budgetary vote has been created, pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-8">Federal-Provincial Fiscal
Arrangements Act</a></em>, to make the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> payment. </p><p>3.4
This guideline should be read in conjunction with</p><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18929">Directive

guideline can be found in the <em>Directive on the Payment, Collection and Remittance of Provincial Taxes and Fees</em>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Transitional Rules"><p>5.1 Departments are required to pay the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on their purchases of taxable
supplies when the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> becomes payable after March 31, 2013.  In general, the
<abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> becomes payable at the earlier of:</p><ul><li>The date the payment for a purchase becomes due<a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span><sup>[1]</sup></a>;
    or </li><li>The date the payment for a purchase is made.</li></ul><p>Note that there are specific
transitional rules stemming from the general rules, such as payments made in
instalments, rental property, conditional sales and instalment sales, deposits
and construction contracts. For details on these transitional rules, departments
can consult the Revenu Québec website <a href="http://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/entreprise/taxes/tvq_tps/perception/moment_ou_tpstvq_exigibles.aspx">When
the GST and <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> are payable</a>, or contact Revenu Québec directly (see section
9).</p><p>5.2
Departments are exempt from paying the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on their purchases of taxable
supplies when the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> becomes payable before April 1, 2013. The exemption
certificate is used as a proof of exemption status in these situations. Note
that the exemption certificate is no longer valid as of April 1, 2013.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Payment of the QST"><p>Starting April 1, 2013, departments are required to pay the
  <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on their purchases of taxable supplies made in Quebec and to subsequently
claim a rebate through the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> Federal Rebate Administrator (see section 8). In
addition, a new financial asset reporting account, the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> Refundable Advance
Account (<abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr>), has also been created to record the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> paid or payable that
is eligible for a government rebate from Revenu Québec. </p><section anchor="6.1"><title>6.1 Approvals<a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span><sup>[2]</sup></a></title><p>6.1.1
Approval limits established under legislation, regulation or Treasury
Board policy or as defined by the Deputy Head normally include all applicable
taxes. The application, however, depends on the wording found in the relevant legislation,
regulation or policy. In the absence of wording specifically excluding tax from
cost calculations, approval limits are inclusive of taxes.</p><p>6.1.2
  For the exercise of the approval authorities, such as expenditure
  initiation, commitment control, and transaction authorities, the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> is to be
included in the total amount.</p><p>6.1.3
For the exercise of project or program approvals that will take place in
the province of Quebec, the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> is to be included in the total costs, including
where project/program approvals are sought through the Treasury Board submission
process. The total estimated cost (<abbr title="Total estimated cost">TEC</abbr>) of a project or program is to be
calculated both with and without the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>. The <abbr title="Total estimated cost">TEC</abbr> exclusive of the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> is the
amount that will be charged to the departmental appropriation. The <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> portion will
be charged to the <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr> as applicable.</p></section><section anchor="6.2" title="6.2 Transfer payments"><p>6.2.1
  Transfer payments are monetary payments, or transfers of goods, services
  or assets made on the basis of an appropriation, to a third party, including a
  Crown Corporation, that do not result in the acquisition by the Government of
  Canada of any goods, services or assets. Transfer payments are categorized as
  grants, contributions, and other transfer payments. Transfer payments do not
include investments, loan or loan guarantees.</p><p>6.2.2
Transfer payments made for a public purpose that result in no supply
made by the recipient of transfer payments to either the department (grantor)
or a specified third party are not treated as the payments for a supply (e.g.
goods or services) and are therefore not subject to <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>.</p><p>6.2.3
When a department provides funding through a transfer payment agreement
to a third party (the recipient) to undertake a project, the transfer payment
agreement may provide that the funding can be used to reimburse all or part of
the costs incurred by the recipient in carrying out the project. The <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> paid
by the recipient on its inputs to a transfer payment project may be considered
to be part of the eligible project costs except for those amounts that a recipient
is entitled to recover through an Input Tax Refund (<abbr title="Input tax refund">ITR</abbr>) or a <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> rebate under
the <a href="http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/T_0_1/T0_1_A.html"><em>Act
Respecting the Quebec Sales Tax</em></a>. The portion of the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> cost that is
not eligible for reimbursement to the recipient through an <abbr title="Input tax refund">ITR</abbr> or a <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> rebate
may be considered as part of eligible project costs. </p><p>6.2.4
It should be noted, however, that a transfer payment falling within
Treasury Board's definition of a transfer payment may still be subject to <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>.
Where there is a direct link between the transfer payment and a supply to the
department (a grantor) or a specified third party, the payment may be an amount
payable for a supply and may be subject to <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>. When in doubt as to whether <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> applies to a specific transfer payment, departments are to request a ruling
from Revenu Québec.</p></section><section anchor="6.3" title="6.3 Contracts"><p>6.3.1
Procurement contracts for goods, services, and construction services, as
defined by the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494">Contracting Policy</a></em>,
are always subject to applicable taxes. When a contract is subject to <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>,
departments are responsible for paying the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> and charging the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to the <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr>.</p><p>6.3.2
The applicability of the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to a contract is the responsibility of the
supplier, in accordance with Revenu Québec's place of supply rules. If there
are questions as to the applicability of the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to a given contract,
contracting authorities in departments are encouraged to consult their legal
counsel and Revenu Québec.</p><p>6.3.3
For additional information, see <em><a href="/pubs_pol/dcgpubs/ContPolNotices/2013/01-04-eng.asp">Contracting
Policy Notice 2013-1</a></em>.</p></section><section anchor="6.4" title="6.4 Real Property Transactions"><p>6.4.1
Acquisitions of Real Property, as defined in the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-8.4">Federal Real Property and
Federal Immovables Act</a></em>, that add to the federal inventory, are subject
to applicable taxes. When a real property transaction is subject to QST,
departments are responsible for paying the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> and charging the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to the <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr>.</p><p>6.4.2
The applicability of the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to a real property transaction is the
responsibility of the owner or the lessor, in accordance with Revenu Québec's
place of supply rules. If there are questions as to the applicability of the
<abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to a given real property transaction, departments are encouraged to consult
their legal counsel and Revenu Québec.</p></section><section anchor="6.5" title="6.5 Allowances and Reimbursements paid to employees"><p>Departments are
to record and report <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on allowances and reimbursements paid to employees for
expenses they incur while on government business as follows: </p><p>6.5.1
  <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on allowances paid to employees</p><ul><li>An allowance<a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span><sup>[3]</sup></a>
    is a periodic payment or other payments that an employee receives from his or
    her employer and that is used to pay expenses incurred in the course of his/her
    employment without the employee having to provide receipts for how the amount was
    spent. The allowance is normally paid to employees who were on travel status
    for government business. In this way, it could include items such as meal
    allowances, allowances for daily incidentals and pre-established kilometric
    rates etc as set out under the <em>National Joint Council Travel Directive</em>.</li><li>The <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr> may be charged for <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on allowances paid to
employees to cover taxable expenses that employees incur within Quebec. </li><li>The method to be used to calculate the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on allowances consists
of applying 9.975/109.975ths (or 9.07%) to the total amount of allowances paid
to employees. Note that departments may charge this amount to the QST RAA when
all the following conditions are met as required by Revenu Québec:
  <ul><li>The allowance is paid to an employee of the department;              </li><li>The allowance is paid either for acquiring property or services at
least 90% of which are taxable, or for the use of a motor vehicle where the
kilometric rate allowance is paid;            </li><li>The property (e.g., goods or meals) or services are acquired or
take place in Quebec, including the use of motor vehicles; and            </li><li>The property (e.g., goods) or services are acquired for the use
of the department in conducting government business.             </li></ul></li></ul><p>6.5.2
  <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on reimbursements to employees</p><ul><li>A reimbursement is any amount that an employee receives from his
or her employer in respect of expenses (e.g., course fees, transportation and
office supplies) that he or she personally incurred for the purpose of
government business. The employee is to account for how the amount was spent
(i.e., the employee is to provide receipts or other supporting documentation to
the employer). Note that reimbursements to employees do not include amounts paid
on departmental acquisition cards, departmental travel expense cards and departmental
travel expense accounts. Refer to the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17059">Directive on
  Acquisition Cards</a></em> and <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15783">Directive on Travel
    Cards and Travellers Cheques</a></em> for further information. Note that
    departmental employees are expected to apply these cards in the appropriate
    contexts. </li><li>The <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr> would be charged for <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on expenses reimbursed to
employees. Because <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> is not applicable outside of the province, when a claim
includes expenses incurred both within and outside of the province, the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to
be charged to the <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr> is to be calculated on the Quebec purchases only. </li><li>There are two methods to calculate the amount of QST on the
    reimbursement:     
    <ul class="noBullet"><li><strong>Method 1:</strong>
        this method consists of calculating 9/109ths (or 8.26%) of the total amount of
        reimbursable expenses when 90% or more of these expenses are subject to <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>. 
       </li><li><strong>Method 2</strong>:
        this method involves using the actual amount of <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> incurred on all expenses.
      </li></ul></li><li>Note that departments may charge
    this amount to the <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr> when all the following conditions are met as
    required by Revenu Québec:
    <ul><li>The reimbursement is made to an employee; and            </li><li>The employee acquired, consumed or used taxable property or
        services in the course of conducting government business.            </li></ul></li><li>Departments may select different methods of calculation for
    different categories of reimbursed amounts (e.g., memberships, course fees,
    hotel expenses, tolls). The method of calculation selected by a department is
    to be used consistently within each category across the department throughout
    the fiscal year. For example, if a department chooses method 1 to calculate the
    tax paid in respect of expenses for one employee, the department is to use the
    same method for such expenses reimbursed to all other employees during the
    fiscal year.    </li></ul></section><section anchor="6.6" title="6.6 Audit trail and supporting documentation"><p>Departments are
to keep proper records and an audit trail for six years following the year when
the claim for the government reimbursement is submitted to enable the
verification of amounts charged to the <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr>. Refer to <a href="http://publiservice.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/rg/airg-rgin/2013-001/index-eng.html">Receiver
General Notice 2013-001</a> for additional information.</p></section><section anchor="6.7" title="6.7 Self-assessment"><p>Under the <em>Act
respecting the Quebec Sales Tax</em>, self-assessment generally refers to the obligation
of the recipient of a taxable supply (i.e., property or a service) to calculate
and remit the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on that supply in situations where the supplier is not
required to collect and remit the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>. Federal government departments are not subject
to any self-assessment provisions of the Act.</p></section><section anchor="6.8" title="6.8 Importation of property or services"><p>When a department
imports/brings a taxable supply from outside of Canada or from another province
or territory into Quebec and where the supplier is not required to collect and
remit the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>, the department will not pay <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> on these importations.</p></section><section anchor="6.9" title="6.9 Disputes with suppliers of property or services over payment of QST&#xD;&#xA;invoiced"><p>Suppliers that
are <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> registrants are always liable for remitting <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> to Revenu Québec even
where the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> remains uncollected. Where <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> is not remitted as required under the <em><a href="http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/T_0_1/T0_1_A.html">Act
respecting the Quebec Sales Tax</a></em>, the suppliers may also be liable for
applicable penalties and interest. Departments are not to engage in a dispute
with a supplier over the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> portion of an invoice. Rather, it is recommended
that a department first pay the amount of the tax invoiced by the supplier and
then seek resolution from Revenu Québec (see section 9). </p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7.&#xD;&#xA;Recording of the QST"><section anchor="7.1" title="7.1 Accounting treatment – taxable purchases"><p>7.1.1
When making purchases of taxable supplies, departments are to record the
  <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> payable to the suppliers at the same time as the related property or
services are recorded in the departmental financial system. The <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> payable is
to be recorded in the <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr>. The full amount of the invoice (including <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr>)
is to be recorded as an account payable.</p><p>7.1.2
For codes to be used to record the <abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> and the accounting treatment, refer

that are eligible for a government reimbursement from Revenu Québec is to be
charged to a department's <abbr title="QST refundable advance account">QST RAA</abbr>.

status for government business (e.g., meal allowances, daily incidentals and standard
kilometric rates).     </li><li><abbr title="Quebec sales tax">QST</abbr> deemed paid on expenses reimbursed to employees for expenses
they personally incur while on government business (e.g. course fees,
