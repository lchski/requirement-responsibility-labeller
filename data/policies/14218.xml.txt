Options for executives"><p><strong>Executives have two options:</strong></p><p>Option 1. Leave the core public administration and seek employment elsewhere,</p><p>or</p><p>Option 2. Seek continuing employment in the core public administration.</p><p>2.1 <strong>Option 1. Executives leaving the core public administration to seek employment elsewhere</strong></p><div class="indent1"><p>2.1.1 A career transition agreement is developed in accordance with Appendix C: <em>Instructions for Developing a Career Transition Agreement</em><em>.</em></p><p>2.1.2 The department negotiates the date of departure with the executive.

An executive can only contribute to the pension plan for a total of 5 years in a career, while on leave without pay for personal reasons.</li><li>An assignment to another employment sector in accordance with the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12552">Policy on Interchange Canada</a></em> can be authorized. See Appendix B-2.</li></ul></div><p><strong>2.2 Option 2. Executives wishing to seek continued employment inside the core public administration.</strong></p><div class="indent1"><p>2.2.1 The department declares the executive surplus and gives him or her formal written notice with the dates of the beginning and end of the surplus period clearly noted.</p><p>2.2.2 The department notifies the Public Service Commission of the executive's surplus status immediately.</p><p>2.2.3 For an executive from EX-01 to EX-03, the Public Service Commission endeavours to find alternative employment at the same level in a department or agency governed by the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/">Public Service Employment Act</a>.</em> OCHRO takes the same steps for an executive at the EX-04 and EX-05 levels. Placement at a lower level is also possible.</p><p>2.2.4 If the executive accepts an appointment to a position with a lower maximum salary, he or she will become subject to Salary Maintenance and other compensation treatments as outlined in the <em>Directive on Executive Compensation.</em></p><p>2.2.5 If the executive changes his or her decision and decides to leave the core public administration during the surplus period, the department can negotiate a Career Transition Agreement, taking into account the time already spent in surplus status. In such cases, the executive resigns (is not laid off) and is not entitled to one year of priority for appointment.</p><p>2.2.6 Executives who wish to continue their core public administration employment but are unsuccessful at finding a new position are laid off on the date of lay off indicated in the notification letter.</p><p>2.2.7 Laid off executives are eligible to receive only their normal severance entitlement and a cash pay off of any accumulated but unused vacation leave credits. They may also be eligible for a lump sum performance award under the Performance Management Program if they have worked in their position for a sufficient period of time prior to termination of employment to conduct a meaningful evaluation.</p><p>2.2.8 Executives who are laid off may have one year of priority for reintegration to the core public administration in accordance with the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/">Public Service Employment Act</a>.</em></p></div></section></appendix><appendix anchor="B1" title="Appendix B-1 - Executives on Leave Without Pay in a Career Transition Situation"><p>Executives on leave without pay (LWOP), must be notified in writing if their position becomes surplus to requirements due to lack of work, discontinuance of a function, or the transfer of work or a function outside those portions of the federal public administration named in Schedule I, IV or V to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a></em>, and provided with the following two options:</p><p>1. resign from the core public administration; or</p><p>2. seek continuing employment after the conclusion of their scheduled period of LWOP.</p><section anchor="B1.1" title="1. Resign from the Core Public Administration"><p>The executive must inform the deputy head in writing that he or she will not seek further core public administration employment upon return from LWOP.</p><p>An executive terminated in this way is eligible for a career transition agreement developed in accordance with <em>Appendix C: Instructions for Developing a Transition Agreement</em> with the exception that he or she is not eligible to negotiate a lump sum payment in lieu of a notice period. The executive is not eligible for this lump sum since he or she is on LWOP and consequently is not drawing a salary. It is an inappropriate use of this directive to terminate the leave of the executive and reappoint him or her expressly for the purpose of providing this lump sum payment in lieu of the notice period.</p><p>The executive resigns and waives priority for appointment rights, if any. The executive is also eligible to receive any earned severance entitlements and a cash pay out of any accumulated but unused vacation leave credits.</p></section><section anchor="B1.2" title="2. Seek Continuing Employment"><p>The executive informs the deputy head in writing that he or she will seek further core public administration employment upon returning from LWOP.</p><p>If there is an entitlement to a priority, the department notifies the Public Service Commission (PSC) of the executive's status as a surplus priority as soon as possible.</p><p>The PSC administers the matching and referral of priority executives to positions for which the executive may be qualified. The PSC and the department try to place the executive.</p><p>If unsuccessful in finding further employment after a one-year period, commencing on the date the employee returns from leave without pay and notifies the department that he or she is available for work, the executive will be laid off and will be eligible to receive only his or her earned severance entitlement and a cash pay out of any accumulated but unused vacation leave credits.</p><p>Employees who are laid off may have one year of priority for reintegration to the core public administration in accordance with the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/">Public Service Employment Act</a> (PSEA).</em></p><p><strong>Note on Executives on Short-term Leave</strong></p><p>It may be appropriate to provide pay in lieu of a notice period to an executive who becomes surplus at the end of the period of unpaid leave when the executive has departed on LWOP with a guarantee of return to the same position (e.g. on return from maternity leave, or when the approved period of leave is short and the executive's position was not staffed).</p><p><strong>Note on Executives on LWOP to Work for International Organizations</strong></p><p>Executives who accept assignments to further Canada's foreign policy objectives and/or to represent Canada at international organizations should be assured of support for reintegration to the core public administration upon their return to Canada. Good human resources planning should ensure reintegration of these executives at the end of such periods of LWOP. However, if this is impossible, the deputy head may offer the executive a lump sum in lieu of the formal notice period to a maximum of 26 weeks upon the executive's return to Canada in return for their resignation from the core public administration. This lump sum may be given only where there was a formal written agreement documenting the purpose of the leave and management's endorsement of the international assignment.</p><p>When an executive who is on LWOP to work with an international organization becomes surplus, and voluntarily decides not to return to a position within the core public administration at the end of the period of approved leave but to remain with that organization permanently, the executive will not be eligible for any period of paid notice or pay in lieu of notice at the end of the period of approved leave. Under these circumstances the employee would resign in accordance with PSEA section 63 and the normal entitlements applicable to a voluntary resignation apply.</p><p>Executives who wish to return to Canada and seek further employment in the core public administration are treated in accordance with option 2.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="B2" title="Appendix B-2 - Career Transition Assignments under Interchange Canada"><p>For surplus executives not interested in pursuing further employment in the public service, departments may authorize a transition assignment to another employment sector under the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12552">Policy on Interchange Canada</a></em>.</p><p>Prior to the commencement of the Interchange Canada assignment, surplus executives must agree, in writing, to resign as of the lay off date of their core public administration employment and will be eligible only for their normal severance entitlement and pay out of unused accumulated vacation leave credits. They will not be eligible for any of the cash or non-cash elements that could be provided as part of a Career Transition Agreement.</p><p>Executives laid off while on Interchange Canada assignments are not eligible for priority consideration for reintegration into the core public administration.</p><p>Executives laid off while on Interchange Canada assignments may be eligible, at the deputy head's discretion, for a lump sum payment for their performance during their last year of employment. Instructions regarding this can be found in the <em>Directive on the Performance Management Program (PMP) for Executives</em>.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C - Instructions for Developing a Career Transition Agreement"><p>1.
