Where such determination is made, the garnishee contact:</p><ul><li>enters information on the garnishment log;</li><li>informs the employee immediately that a garnishee summons has been received. If the employee disputes the garnishment, explain that Her Majesty is required by law to remit the garnishable moneys until the amounts owed under the summons are paid or the summons is withdrawn by the applicant.</li></ul><p>Where it is determined that the judgment debtor is not an employee, the garnishee contact should make reasonable efforts to determine if the judgment debtor is a contractor or employee of another federal department or agency falling under the GAPDA. Where such determination is made, the garnishee contact should transfer the file promptly to the appropriate garnishee contact and advise accordingly the Garnishment Registry that sent the documents.</p><p>Where the judgment debtor is not an employee or contractor of Her Majesty, the garnishee contact advises the appropriate Court or <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr> within fifteen days as set out in the garnishee summons and the appropriate Garnishment Registry.</p><p>Where the garnishment documents are received directly by a department or agency, they should be returned immediately to the applicant for service on the appropriate Garnishment Registry as set out in the GAPDA Regulations.</p><h4>Response Time</h4><p>The garnishee summons binds Her Majesty 15 days after the day on which the documents are served on a Garnishment Registry.</p><p>In the case of a federal employee, the following money is bound by a garnishee summons:</p><ul><li>the garnishable salary to be paid on the last day of the second pay period next following the pay period in which Her Majesty is bound by the garnishee summons; and, when the garnishee summons has a continuing effect, the garnishable salary to be paid on the last day of each subsequent pay period or at the time of any other remuneration;</li><li>the garnisheed moneys by way of a cheque are to be sent to the court or the <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr> office, indicated in the garnishee summons, within 15 calendar days after the last day on which the money was garnisheed (see Appendix A), together with the response form as required by the applicable provincial law. Failure to comply within the above time limits could increase the risk of liability and/or negative attention for the federal government.</li></ul><p>Where no money is owed to a federal employee during a particular pay period for a particular reason or an employee is no longer employed by Her Majesty, the response form as required by the applicable provincial law should be sent to the court or the <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr> office indicated in the garnishee summons indicating the reasons why no garnishable moneys will be sent. In these circumstances, a copy of such response must be provided to the appropriate Garnishment Registry.</p></section><section anchor="D2" title="Procedures to Withhold and Remit Amount to the Court or the MEP"><h4>Note:</h4><p>When garnishment documents are served in accordance with the GAPDA, the garnishee summons is binding on the Crown, according to the garnishment laws of the province from which it was issued, even when the employee who is the judgment debtor resides or works outside that province.</p><h4>Validity Period of a Garnishee Summons</h4><p>Where during the validity period of a garnishee summons, an employee is not in receipt of salary / remuneration during a particular pay period, the garnishee contact advises the court or <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr>, with a copy to the Garnishment Registry office, why no moneys are being garnisheed by completing the applicable provincial response form. The court or <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr>, with a copy to the Garnishment Registry, is also to be informed when the final payment under a garnishee summons is submitted.</p><h4>Transfer of an Employee or Termination of a Garnishee Summons</h4><p>If an employee moves to another organization covered under Part 1, Division 1 of GAPDA, the garnishee summons is still in effect. Arrange to transfer the active garnishment file immediately to ensure that no garnishee payments are missed in any pay period. The Garnishment Registry office is to be notified, in writing, of the employee's organization change.</p><p>If an employee retires or moves to a private or a public organization not covered by Part I, Division 1 of the GAPDA, notify in writing the Garnishment Registry and the appropriate court or <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr> of the termination date and provide details as to when final garnishment payments will follow. Note that severance payments are subject to garnishment.</p><h4>Judgment Debtor is Not an Employee or a Contractor</h4><p>If the department cannot identify satisfactorily the judgment debtor based on the information provided, the garnishee contact informs the Garnishment Registry immediately, as Section 6 of the Act continues to bind Her Majesty 15 days after the day the documents are served.</p><p>If the judgment debtor is not or is no longer an employee or contractor with the department or agency, the garnishee contact should make reasonable efforts to determine whether the judgment debtor is employed within another department or agency falling under Division I, Part I of GAPDA. Where another department or agency is identified, the garnishee contact should immediately transfer the documents to the other organization and inform the Garnishment Registry.</p><p>If it is determined that the judgment debtor is not or is no longer an employee or contractor of a department or agency falling under Division I, Part I of GAPDA, the garnishee contact should within fifteen days advise the Court or the <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr> accordingly, with a copy to the Garnishment Registry.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="E" title="Appendix E - Payroll Calculations of Garnishable Salary"><section anchor="E1" title="Example 1 - Calculations for a Commercial Debt"><ul><li>ongoing garnishment summons received by the Garnishment Registry- December 9, 2010 for debt of $400.00;</li><li>in Ontario, a maximum of 20% of the garnishable salary for a commercial debt may be garnished, however, a lesser fixed dollar amount may be    requested by the court;</li><li>summons is binding fifteen days thereafter- December 24, 2010 (in pay period # 1 December 23, 2010 to January 5, 2011);</li><li>must be actioned for pay period # 3 ending February 2, 2011 (second pay period following pay period in which summons becomes binding);</li><li>the moneys must be in the hands of the court no later than on February 17, 2011 (within 15 days after February 2, 2011).</li></ul><h4>Note:</h4><p>In the case of a continuing garnishee summons, any supplementary payments (e.g. overtime or retroactive pay) received during the pay period are subject to garnishment, if required to satisfy the judgment;</p><p>If the garnishable salary of the employee changes as the result of a variation in the gross salary or an extra duty payment, the garnisheed amount is re-calculated and adjusted accordingly;</p><p>A garnishee summons may indicate either a fixed amount or percentage to be garnisheed per pay.</p></section><section anchor="E2" title="Example 2 - Calculation for a Family Support Payment"><ul><li>ongoing garnishment summons received by Garnishment Registry from a <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr>- December 9, 2010 for $400.00 per month, with no arrears;</li><li>in Quebec, a maximum of 50% of the garnishable salary for family support payments, however, a lesser fixed dollar amount may be requested by the    court;</li><li>summons is binding on December 24, 2010 (in pay period # 1; December 23, 2010 to January 5, 2011);</li><li>must be actioned for pay period # 3 ending February 2, 2011 (second pay period following pay period in which summons becomes binding);</li><li>the moneys must be in the hands of the <abbr title="maintenance enforcement program">MEP</abbr> no later than on February 17, 2011 (within 15 days after February 2, 2011).</li></ul></section><section anchor="E3" title="Example 3- Calculation of the garnishable salary over two pay cycles"><ul><li>add garnishable salary for each pay period: $1,068.71 + $1,062.85 = <strong>$ 2,131.56;</strong></li><li>divide total garnishable salary by 2: $2,131.56 divided by 2 = <strong>$1,065.78 bi-weekly;</strong></li><li>multiply by 50%: $1,065.78 multiplied by .50 = <strong>$ 532.89 per pay period;</strong></li><li>the amount to be remitted to the court is $200.00 per pay period because the garnishment summons is for $ 400.00 per month;</li><li>prepare the pay transaction for the on-going garnishment deduction for $ 400.00 per month in the pay system (with the appropriate codes for family support no arrears).</li></ul><h4>Note:</h4><p>Where there is more than one active garnishee summons, the family support garnishee summons takes precedence over commercial debts.
