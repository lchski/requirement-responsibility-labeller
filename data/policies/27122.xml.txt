As a result, Government of Canada departments must be ever more vigilant in today’s dynamic threat environment as malicious code can be hidden in known or trusted web sites, tools and services.</p><p>Departments remain responsible for ensuring that they comply with the requirements established in Government of Canada security policy instruments (e.g., <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578&amp;section=text">Policy on Government Security</a></em>, <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16579&amp;section=text"><em>Directive on Departmental Security Management</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12328&amp;section=text"><em>Operational Security Standard: Management of Information Technology Security (MITS)</em></a>, <a href="http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/its-sti/publications/itsg-csti/itsg33-overview-apercu-eng.html"><em>Information Technology Security Guidance-33</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/publication/itsb-89a"><em>Communications Security Establishment Canada Top 35 Mitigation Measures</em>)</a>.</p><p>Departments are to ensure that, based on an analysis of departmental security needs, security measures from the following non-exhaustive list are selected, properly implemented and layered in a manner that will provide defence-in-depth and will help to protect Government of Canada electronic networks, devices and information:</p><ul><li>Use currently supported versions of operating systems and applications (and ensure that they remain patched and up-to-date) to reduce vulnerabilities in software that can be remotely exploited;</li><li>Disable unnecessary features in operating systems, applications and web browsers to reduce attack surface;</li><li>Disable auto-run functionality on endpoints to prevent accidental code execution;</li><li>Enable data execution prevention in operating systems and applications to reduce the risk of memory overflow execution by malicious code;</li><li>Use antivirus software with up-to-date signatures and heuristic detection capabilities at the gateway and on endpoints to detect and prevent the execution of malicious code;</li><li>Implement host-based intrusion detection/prevention (IDP) systems to improve the ability to detect and identify anomalous behaviours;</li><li>Use whitelisting or blacklisting to prevent access to malicious websites, tools and <span class="noWrap">web-based</span> services from GC networks and devices;</li><li>Implement centralized logging for computer events, with regular log analysis, to improve the ability to detect and identify anomalous behaviours and to assist with incident management and forensic analysis of compromised systems;</li><li>Ensure that user accounts with administrative or root privileges are not used to search, browse or collaborate over the internet – these users should instead use normal user accounts with standard privileges; or a solution that will prevent the use of, or drop, administrator privileges;</li><li>Use network segmentation, segregation and access controls to control how devices and systems that allow users to access Internet-based web-content are allowed to interact with other high-value systems and assets; and</li><li>Ensure that security awareness programs include:
     <ul><li>Material notifying users that they are not permitted to post or share sensitive GC information (i.e. classified, protected, proprietary or otherwise restricted-distribution material) on public web sites, tools and services;</li><li>Material discussing the threats and risks associated with Internet-based web-content as well as measures users can take to reduce risks;</li><li>Material describing the threats and risks associated with mobile device use as well as measures users can take to reduce risks; and</li><li>Regular reminders and updates to maintain awareness and to reflect the latest trends and threats.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Note: In the event of any discrepancy between the associated security requirements identified in this appendix and the security requirements identified in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578&amp;section=text"><em>Policy on Government Security</em></a> and its supporting instruments, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578&amp;section=text"><em>Policy on Government Security</em></a> is to be considered the authoritative source.</p></appendix></appendices></doc>
