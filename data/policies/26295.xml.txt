of Canada Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Adoption Strategy.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3 Background"><p>The Internet's remaining unused Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) address blocks were allocated in early 2011 to the 
five Regional Internet Registries which allocate Internet addresses to network operators in their region. The Asia-Pacific 
region has experienced strong Internet growth and has been a lead adopter of <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>, 
now using <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> for all new growth. Due to the address space pressures, 
many governments and enterprises around the world are actively adopting <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>, 
which provides a much larger address space.</p><p>Although <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr> and <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> 
are not backwards compatible, there are mechanisms to link the two, such as translation and tunnelling, which can be used 
to assist in deployment during the transition from <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr> to
<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>. Both <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr> and
<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> networks will coexist in the global Internet for some time as systems 
become inter-connected and move to a dual-stack architecture.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4 Context"><p>The advent of <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> will have an impact on the Government of Canada, 
whose business is geographically dispersed throughout the world. The Government of Canada conducts business with clients, 
suppliers and global partners who are (or soon will be) on <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> networks, 
and as a consequence, the Government of Canada must adopt <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>.</p><p>The Government of Canada <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> Adoption Strategy is designed to ensure 
the continuity of Government of Canada services. Adoption of <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> by the 
Government of Canada will provide seamless, uninterrupted access to Government of Canada services by Canadians and users 
around the world. It also ensures continued access to global Internet resources by public service employees in carrying 
out their job functions.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5 Network Equipment Procurement"><p>Network equipment (e.g., routers, proxy servers, firewalls) is procured for Government of Canada networks through a variety 
of means, including contracts and standing offers such as Network Equipment Support Services (NESS).
<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> functions specified in this guideline are expected to be incorporated 
in these procurement vehicles where IP-based network equipment is specified.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6 Audience"><p>This guideline supports the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249">Directive on Management of Information Technology</a></em> 
by providing functional specialists, within Government of Canada departments and at Shared Services Canada, with network 
equipment procurement guidance to assist in the adoption of <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>.</p><p>The target audience for this guideline includes Government of Canada departmental clients, technical authorities, network 
architects, network procurement technical analysts and contracting authorities.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7 Definitions"><p>There are numerous generic terms such as "<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>-enabled", "<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>-ready", "<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>-compatible", 
and "<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>-capable", that are used to identify
<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> functionality in network equipment. There is no standard interpretation 
of these terms, which can lead to confusion among buyers.</p><p>In this guideline, the term "<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr>-capable" means network equipment that 
meets the set of functions identified in the <a href="/it-ti/ipv6/tr-et-eng.asp">Technical Requirements for Internet Protocol 
Version 6 Network Equipment Procurement Guideline</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="8 Usage recommendations"><p>This document provides guidance for those procuring network equipment, by identifying functions that are essential to 
the proper functioning of equipment in a Government of Canada <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> environment 
(see the <a href="/it-ti/ipv6/tr-et-eng.asp">Technical Requirements for Internet Protocol Version 6 Network Equipment Procurement 
Guideline</a>). A list of base functions that applies to all network equipment is followed by lists of functions that apply 
to the equipment when used in specific situations. Following these is a section that addresses future needs, also organized 
according to the network scenario in which the equipment will be used.</p><p>When preparing network equipment requirements, buyers should include the <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> 
functions referred to above, as specified in the <a href="/it-ti/ipv6/tr-et-eng.asp">Technical Requirements for Internet 
Protocol Version 6 Network Equipment Procurement Guideline</a>.</p><p>It is possible that not all functions listed are currently supported by all vendors and that some of the quoted Internet 
standards may be updated or become obsolete. As a result, a "best fit" may be required when equipment must be replaced due 
to end-of-life or other considerations, and cannot wait for the availability of the full
<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> functionality recommended in this guideline.</p><p>Although beyond the scope of this guideline, buyers may also wish to specify performance requirements (e.g., throughput, 
latency, packet loss, jitter), for both <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr> and
<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> for the equipment being procured, because their performance characteristics 
may differ. This could be particularly noticeable in cases where <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> functionality 
requires additional hardware or software modules.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="9" title="9 References"><section anchor="9.1" title="9.1 Related policy instruments and publications"><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755">Policy on Management of Information Technology</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249">Directive on Management of Information Technology</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578">Policy on Government Security</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12328">Operational Security Standard: Management of Information Technology Security
