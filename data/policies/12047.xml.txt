Purpose"><p>Deputy heads are accountable to their Minister and the Treasury Board for the management of real property in their organizations. This standard establishes the information management requirements that will ensure compliance with the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy on the Management of Real Property</a></em>. That policy requires that deputy heads ensure custodians and Crown corporations regularly record, update 
and certify information in the Directory of Federal Real Property (DFRP). Custodians and consolidated Crown corporations are required to do the same for the Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory (FCSI).</p><p>This standard is issued pursuant to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>, subsections 7(1), 9(1.1), 9(2) and 149(1).</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Part 1 - Directory of Federal Real Property"><section anchor="4" title="3.

It provides information concerning federal real property to ministers, members of Parliament, federal departments, Crown corporations, 
central agencies and the general public.</p></section><section anchor="6" title="5.
