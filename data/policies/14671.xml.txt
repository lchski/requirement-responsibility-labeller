Introduction"><p>In the Treasury Board <em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em>, materiel is defined as "all movable assets, excluding money or records, acquired by Her Majesty in right of Canada." Movable assets are tangible and include a broad range of goods such as equipment (e.g., office, information technology, telecommunications, scientific), furniture and furnishings, and larger goods (e.g., vehicles and ships).</p><section anchor="1.1" title="1.1 Purpose"><p>The purpose of this Guide is to assist managers in implementing the government's <em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em> and its directives related to materiel management.</p><p>Based on a life-cycle approach, this document provides guidelines and good practices that complement the mandatory direction 
  provided in the Policy. In some cases, it also details procedures to be followed stemming from the application of other 
  Treasury Board policies and directives. This format enables managers to adhere to a common set of procedures and to ensure 
  that their decision-making and management practices are consistent with the full range of good practices and guidelines 
  relevant to the management of materiel.</p><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> "Department" refers to departments and agencies named in Schedule 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>.</p></div></section><section anchor="1.2" title="1.2 Scope"><p>Flowing from the Treasury Board <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a>, this document sets out guidelines and good practices for the management of 
  materiel. The content of this Guide, the Policy, and its associated directives should be read in conjunction with other 
  policies and requirements that are outside the scope of this document. The reader is encouraged to review the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a>.</p><p>This chapter highlights and expands on some mandatory policy direction and provides guidance and additional information 
  on the management of materiel.</p></section><section anchor="1.3" title="1.3 Background"><p>Ministers are accountable for the management of materiel to support the delivery of programs according to their departmental 
  mandates. Deputy heads are accountable to their respective ministers and to the Treasury Board for the sound stewardship 
  of the materiel entrusted to them or used by their respective organizations.</p><p>This managerial structure is framed by the principles set out in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a>. 
  The Policy must be read in the context of related Treasury Board policies, especially those governing investment planning, 
  contracting, and project management. In fulfilling these responsibilities, it is important that managers adhere to the <em><a href="/pubs_pol/hrpubs/tb_851/vec-cve-eng.asp">Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service</a></em> produced by the Canada Public Service Agency.</p><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> This Guide was developed to provide departments with the best advice available on how to implement 
    the requirements set out in the Treasury Board's <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a>. 
    While adherence to this Guide is voluntary, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat may request that departments explain 
    any deviation from the advice provided.</p></div><p>Additional mandatory requirements are set out in the four Treasury Board directives associated with the <em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em>: </p><ul><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12063"><em>Controlled Goods Directive</em></a>;</li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12064"><em>Directive on Fleet Management: Executive Vehicles</em></a>; </li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12065"><em>Directive on Fleet Management: Light Duty Vehicles</em></a>; and</li><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12066"><em>Directive on Disposal of Surplus Materiel</em></a>.</li></ul></section></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Objectives of Materiel Management"><p>The management of materiel is very much a balancing act. It requires that departments fulfill program objectives while 
  balancing financial and efficiency-related materiel considerations with broader public issues and considerations, such as 
  environmental impact. The objective of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> is for materiel to be managed by departments in a sustainable and financially responsible manner that supports the cost-effective 
  and efficient delivery of government programs.</p><section anchor="2.1" title="2.1 Fulfilling the requirements of the Treasury Board Policy on Management of Materiel"><p>Departments require a framework for managing materiel that does the following:</p><ul><li>reflects an integrated approach to risk management;</li><li>provides relevant performance information;</li><li>establishes clear accountability and decision-making regimes that are consistent with organizational 
    resources and capacity; and </li><li>supports timely, informed materiel management decisions and the strategic outcomes of departmental 
    programs. </li></ul><p>The overall extent to which departments' materiel assets meet the Policy's requirements is measured by an ongoing and 
  systematic assessment of the physical condition, functionality, use, and financial performance of these assets against established 
  targets based on appropriate benchmarks.</p><p>The policy requirements, which are aligned with life-cycle materiel management, are detailed throughout this Guide.</p><h4>2.1.1 Materiel management framework</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.1) requires deputy heads to ensure that a materiel management framework is in place and 
    that it does the following:</p><ul><li>reflects an integrated approach to risk management;</li><li>provides relevant performance information; </li><li>sets out clear accountability and decision-making regimes that are consistent with 
      organizational resources and capacity; and </li><li>supports timely, informed materiel management decisions and the strategic outcomes 
      of departmental programs.</li></ul></div><p>Departments have a responsibility to establish and maintain a management framework that consists of the following:</p><ul><li>appropriate accountability and decision-making structures; </li><li>clearly communicated authorities;</li><li>segregated responsibilities;</li><li>appropriate policies and practices; and</li><li>appropriate management, financial, and materiel information systems that support informed decision 
    making and allow for adequate performance monitoring.</li></ul><h4>2.1.2 Performance management</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>a materiel management framework is in place that provides relevant performance information; 
      and</li><li>the overall extent to which departmental materiel assets meet program requirements 
      is measured by an ongoing and systematic assessment of the physical condition, functionality, use, and financial performance 
      of these assets against established targets based on appropriate benchmarks.</li></ul></div><p>A primary component of materiel management systems in the government is a systematic performance measurement framework 
  that provides management with the assurance that materiel management objectives in support of program delivery are being 
  achieved. Departments should establish proper materiel management practices for monitoring asset performance to ensure that 
  repairs, refurbishing, and replacements are carried out before the assets become unserviceable, uneconomical, or both. Establishing 
  these practices is a key objective of life-cycle materiel managementâ€“to be aware of asset life, storage restrictions, and 
  repair and maintenance schedules so that the asset may be properly managed and maintained.</p><p>Departments should have in place an enterprise-wide, integrated materiel management performance management system that 
  would enable materiel managers, at all levels, to establish performance standards and indicators and to achieve an accurate 
  understanding of how well assets are being managed overall. The reports from performance and measurement systems will help 
  support informed decision making about the allocation of resources within and by departments.</p><h4>2.1.3 Management strategies</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.3) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>capital acquisition, operations and maintenance, and disposal strategies are developed 
      based on the findings of ongoing and systematic performance assessment and on an economic and program analysis that 
      considers the full life-cycle costs and benefits of alternative solutions to meeting program needs for materiel assets.</li></ul></div><p>Departments should employ materiel management strategies that add value and support their objectives and priorities through 
  the delivery of the most effective, efficient, timely, and modern materiel management programâ€“providing the right materiel, 
  at the best value, at the right time, while also adhering to government policies and regulations to ensure proper stewardship.</p><h4>2.1.4 Protection of assets</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.4) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>the risk of loss of or damage to federal materiel assets is minimized.</li></ul></div><p>Departments have a responsibility to safeguard public assets. This responsibility includes the implementation of measures 
  for the protection of assets (materiel) and detection of losses. As well, departments must support the national interest 
  and the Government of Canada's business objectives by safeguarding employees and assets and assuring the continued delivery 
  of services. A department's security measures can only be as effective as its ability to monitor its compliance and react 
  to incidents. That is, security policies must also include provisions for the regular inspection and monitoring of asset 
  holdings and the procedures that must be followed when an incident occurs.</p><h4>2.1.5 Heritage</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.5) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>heritage collections are identified and protected; </li><li>the heritage value of these assets is assessed; and </li><li>a record of these assets is kept that includes accurate information on their nature and condition.</li></ul></div><p>The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that cultural heritage is safeguarded for the benefit of all Canadians 
  and is accessible to them. Heritage property can have individual or collective meaning and heritage value and, in many instances, 
  contribute to telling Canada's story. For further information refer to the Treasury Board <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13872"><em>Guide to the Management of 
  Movable Heritage Assets.</em></a></p><h4>2.1.6 Vehicle management</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.6) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>light duty vehicle fleets and executive vehicles are managed as set out in the Treasury 
      Board <em>Directive on Fleet Management: Light Duty Vehicles</em> and in the Treasury Board <em>Directive on Fleet Management: Executive Vehicles</em>.</li></ul></div><p>Departments are responsible for the management of light duty vehicles. Light duty vehicles are purchased using departmental 
  funds, and, although central agency direction can influence purchasing decisions, departments are fundamentally responsible 
  for deciding how many vehicles they require and the composition of vehicles necessary to fulfill their operational duties. 
  Departments and agencies are essentially responsible for all phases of the light duty vehicle life cycle; however, they 
  are guided by the policy direction provided by the Treasury Board. Most departments have their own internal policy related 
  to the ownership, use, maintenance, and disposal of light duty fleets in place, while other departments may simply refer 
  to the applicable Treasury Board policies, directives, and regulations. For further information refer to the Treasury Board <a href="mm-gm/doc/gfm-ggpa/c1-00-eng.aspx"><em>Guide to Fleet Management</em></a>.</p><h4>2.1.7 Environment</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.7) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>material assets are managed and disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner 
      consistent with the principles of sustainable development.</li></ul></div><p>Departments have the responsibility to manage assets in a manner that minimizes the effect on the environment and promotes 
  sustainable development. This responsibility includes applying the three R's (reduce, reuse, and recycle) at each phase 
  of life-cycle materiel management. Specifically, departments should work to minimize resource use, limit the use of hazardous 
  substances, dispose of waste (both hazardous and non-hazardous) in an appropriate manner, and procure greener products. 
  Sustainable development means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
  generations to meet their own needs. In practice, this means that environmental, social, and financial considerations should 
  all be considered in an organization's decision-making process.</p><p>Further information on departments' responsibilities for advancing the protection of the environment and supporting sustainable 
  development is included in the <em><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/politique-policy-eng.html">Policy on Green Procurement</a></em>, 
  published on the website for the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ecologisation-greening/index-eng.html">Office of Greening Government 
  Operations</a> at Public Works and Government Services Canada.</p><h4>2.1.8 Information management</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.8) requires deputy heads to ensure a materiel management information system is in place 
    that does the following: </p><ul><li>is compliant with the requirements of all applicable Treasury Board policies and 
      standards governing the management of information and information technology;</li><li>enables the collection and generation of complete and accurate data on materiel asset 
      holdings (capital assets, inventories, and materiel in use);</li><li>incorporates a risk-based stocktaking schedule;</li><li>is integrated with departmental financial information systems;</li><li>is integrated with its program objectives and Management, Resources, and Results 
      Structure; and</li><li>supports timely, informed materiel management decisions.</li></ul></div><p>Departments have the responsibility to provide both quantitative and qualitative information on the effectiveness of 
  their materiel assets in meeting program requirements. A critical component of any materiel management system is an effective 
  information management capability. This capability is normally achieved through the use of an enterprise resource planning 
  (ERP) system, which offers the following benefits:</p><ul><li>a common database;</li><li>a single point of entry for data;</li><li>the elimination of redundant data;</li><li>the enabling of different users to work with the same information; and</li><li>ease of access to department-wide data.</li></ul><p>Asset visibility is a standard concept in materiel management, universally valued but implemented in vastly differing 
  ways depending on the strategic objectives of the organizations involved. In general terms, asset visibility means the storing 
  and easy retrieval of standard and integrated data that concern materiel holdings, are visible in the same formats, and 
  provide the same information to all management levels and materiel holding points throughout the supply chain. An ERP system 
  can provide a standard set of data related to the life-cycle management of assets, no matter where it is held. This offers 
  effective and efficient management of assets throughout their life cycle and ensures the integration of materiel management, 
  real property, financial, and human resources data.</p><h4>2.1.9 Transfer of assets</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.9) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>the acceptance and treatment of sponsored and donated assets are consistent with the requirements set out in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12316"><em>Communications Policy of the Government of Canada</em></a> and in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12622"><em>Policy on Alternative Service Delivery</em></a>.</li></ul></div><p>The transfer of one department's materiel to another department is strongly encouraged when the use of the materiel is 
  in support of government programs and the use or exchange is cost-effective for the government as a whole. The original 
  department remains responsible for the custody and control of its surplus assets, including its operating costs, until title 
  is transferred to another owner.</p><h4>2.1.10 Asset loans</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.10) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>every loan of a material asset is made by way of a written contract that meets the 
      legal requirements set out in the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-745/page-1.html">Public Property Loans Regulations</a></em>.</li></ul></div><p>The lending of departmental materiel to Crown corporations, other governments' agencies, or the private sector should 
  only take place to support departmental programs or activities. The loan of equipment should not be treated as a method 
  of disposal. Asset loans should be used to make more efficient use of departmental resources by reducing the need to buy 
  additional equipment when available items can serve the purpose. All loans of materiel must be effected using a contract 
  and must comply with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-745/page-1.html"><em>Public Property Loans Regulations</em></a>.</p><h4>2.1.11 Controlled goods</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.11) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>material assets designated as controlled goods, as defined in Part 2 of the  <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/"><em>Defence Production Act</em></a>, are given the level of protection necessary to prevent their unauthorized examination, possession, or transfer; and</li><li>controlled goods are managed in compliance with the Treasury Board  <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12063"><em>Controlled Goods Directive</em></a>.</li></ul></div><p>With respect to managing controlled goods, departments must have procedures to meet strict policy requirements. The <em>Controlled Goods Directive</em> affects all aspects of life-cycle materiel management. Inventory control and disposal 
  management of controlled goods, however, are key to managing them successfully. Departments must ensure that access to their 
  controlled goods is restricted and that all disposals of such goods follow the special requirements of the Directive. When 
  using the disposal services of Public Works and Government Services Canada (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>) or those of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s contractors, departments 
  must ensure that controlled goods are clearly identified as such when they are declared surplus. Departments must keep and 
  maintain detailed inventory records and establish and implement a security plan for each place of 
  business in Canada where controlled goods are kept. Departments must provide training programs for the secure handling of 
  controlled goods. The <a href="http://ssi-iss.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/dmc-cgd/index-eng.html">Controlled Goods Directorate</a> at <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> must 
  be advised, without delay, of any security breaches in relation to controlled goods.</p><h4>2.1.12 Disposal</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062&amp;section=text#cha6"><em>Policy on Management of Materiel</em></a> (section 6.1.12) requires deputy heads to ensure the following:</p><ul><li>the disposal of surplus materiel assets is concluded as effectively as possible, 
      as soon as possible after they become surplus to the requirements of program delivery, and in a manner that obtains 
      highest net value for the Crown; and</li><li>the disposal of surplus materiel assets must be carried out in compliance with the 
      Treasury Board <em>Directive on Disposal of Surplus Materiel</em>.</li></ul></div><p>The identification and disposal of surplus materiel is a critical part of life-cycle materiel management. When it is 
  beyond cost-effective repair or is surplus to the requirements of the Crown, materiel should be declared surplus and disposed 
  of in a manner that obtains best value for the Crown. In this context, <em>best value</em> refers to the selection of a 
  disposal method that obtains the best return for the Crown, taking into account the market price for disposals and the global 
  costs of disposing, including handling, warehousing and maintenance, transportation, overhead, amortization, staff time, 
  and timing of cash expenses and sales, as well as any other related costs. Timely and effective disposal not only yields 
  significant direct and indirect benefits, but it also represents an additional way for departments to visibly support broader 
  government environmental objectives. The sale of surplus departmental materiel can realize new revenue for the department, 
  thereby helping to leverage scarce resources. (See also subsection 3.4 of this Guide, "<a href="#sec3.4">Disposal of government assets</a>").</p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="2.2 Fulfilling departmental policy requirements"><p>Departmental policy provides materiel management employees with formal direction that imposes specific responsibilities 
  and accountabilities within the department. Materiel management specialists must combine their functional expertise with 
  their responsibility to contribute to the management team. This will help the management team satisfy the requirements of 
  the Treasury Board <a href="maf-crg/index-eng.asp">Management Accountability Framework</a>, a set 
  of expectations for good public sector management in a number of different management areas.</p></section><section anchor="2.3" title="2.3 Training and certification for materiel management"><p>Human resources are key to materiel management in supporting departments and agencies in the delivery of their programs. 
  To ensure that employees have the skills, knowledge, and competencies to implement the various policies and manage the government's 
  assets and acquired services, a Professional Development and Certification Program was developed for the federal government's 
  procurement and materiel management functional specialists. This program is managed by the Procurement, Materiel Management 
  and Real Property (PMMRP) Community Management Office (CMO) at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.</p><p>For employees working in materiel management, a professional designation as certified federal specialist in materiel 
  management (CFSMM) may be obtained through the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB), the certification body for the federal 
  government. A professional designation as certified federal specialist in procurement (CFSP) may also be acquired. The Certification 
  Manual, Handbook and forms are available <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/cgsb/home/index-e.html">on the CGSB website</a>.</p><p>For more information on the Federal Government Professional Development and Certification Program, please visit 
the <a href="pd-pp/site/home_accueil-eng.aspx">PMMRP CMO website</a>.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Life-Cycle Materiel Management"><p>Life-cycle materiel management is the effective and efficient management 
  of assets from the identification of requirements to the disposal of the assets. Materiel management strategies must always 
  consider the full life-cycle costs and benefits of the alternatives for meeting program requirements. By using life-cycle 
  costing techniques, departments can evaluate the total costs to the Crown of owning or leasing an asset before it is acquired. 
  This evaluation is accomplished by considering such factors as the current value of the costs of future operation, maintenance, 
  and disposal, in addition to initial and ongoing capital costs. Estimating life-cycle costs also creates standards by which 
  costs can be monitored and controlled after acquisition. By adopting this approach to the management of materiel, departments 
  can ensure that their materiel management and asset management decisions are financially prudent and represent the best 
  value to the Crown.</p><p>The departmental planning phase, which includes business planning and budgeting, is the initial process that determines 
  a department's priorities and strategic program objectives. The materiel life-cycle management process is based on these 
  priorities and objectives. </p><p>The extended life of materiel assets has important implications for decision makers. For instance, an acquisition decision 
  that is based on the lowest purchase price but that ignores potential operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs may result 
  in higher overall costs. Decision making in life-cycle materiel management is an interactive process that considers all 
  four phases of an asset's life cycle. Effective management requires that an appropriate level of management interest and 
  control be maintained through all phases in the materiel asset's life cycle.</p><p>The four phases of life-cycle materiel management are as follows:</p><ol><li><a href="#sec3.1">assessing and planning materiel requirements</a>; </li><li><a href="#sec3.2">acquiring materiel resources</a>;</li><li><a href="#sec3.3">operating, using, and maintaining materiel</a>; and</li><li><a href="#sec3.4">disposing of materiel</a>.</li></ol><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Tip:</strong><br />
    The life-cycle cost (LCC) of materiel assets can be expressed by the following simple formula: LCC = planning costs 
    + acquisition costs + use and operating costs + disposal costs â€“ residual value.</p></div><section anchor="3.1" title="3.1 Assessment and planning"><div class="borderSimple"><p>The overriding objectives of assessment and planning are as follows:</p><ul><li>to ensure that the asset obtained best fits the program or departmental requirements; and</li><li>to ensure that the department's asset base supports its program objectives.</li></ul></div><div class="borderSimple highlightBox"><p>The <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12037&amp;section=text#cha6">Policy on Investment 
    Planningâ€“Assets and Acquired Services</a> (section 6.1.2) states that deputy heads are responsible for ensuring that 
    departmental investment planning does the following:</p><ul><li>is influenced by and supports departmental strategic planning; </li><li>incorporates departmental, portfolio, horizontal, and government-wide perspectives 
      and takes into account strategic government-wide initiatives; </li><li>is aligned with outcomes as set out in the department or agency's <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14252">Management, Resources, and Results

When selected, the contractor carrying out the repairs for the department must be supervised by the assets manager to ensure that the contracts are adhered to and that quality control standards are enforced.</li><li>Establish proper asset management practices to monitor asset performance in accordance with defined performance expectations and to ensure that repairs, refurbishing, or replacements are carried out before the assets become unserviceable, uneconomical to use, or both.</li><li>Establish detailed maintenance policies and procedures depending upon the types of equipment and materiel necessary.</li><li>Monitor and review materiel usage, condition, and consumption rates.</li><li>Create a strategy for maintaining equipment by determining the following:
<ul><li>whether procedures exist for the planning and scheduling of equipment inspection, testing, and maintenance;</li><li>whether equipment maintenance records are maintained;</li><li>whether performance expectations (including functional, financial, and environmental) are clearly defined based on contractual requirements and the manufacturer's statements of commitment, as appropriate;</li><li>whether records are kept of actual inspection, testing, maintenance, maintenance costs, and equipment performance and time lost while awaiting repairs;</li><li>whether the responsibility for reviewing maintenance records is assigned;</li><li>whether the information in maintenance records is used effectively;</li><li>whether there is a linkage of the information in maintenance records to the materiel forecasting process;</li><li>whether maintenance records are analyzed for purposes of assessing economies, efficiencies, and improvements in functional and environmental performance; and</li><li>whether the costs of maintenance contracts are economical compared to the actual costs of repairs.</li></ul></li></ol><p>More specifically, maintenance can be broken down as follows:</p><h4>Unscheduled maintenance or repairs</h4><p>Unscheduled maintenance or repair is any restoration made to an asset that will return it to useful, functioning, or 
  sound condition so that it may serve the purpose or purposes for which it was originally intended. </p><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure that the loss of productive use of the asset is minimized</li></ul><h5>Good practice:</h5><ol><li>Encourage repairs to assets periodically as required at the department's discretion.</li></ol><h4>Planned or scheduled maintenance</h4><p>Planned or scheduled maintenance consists of planned work performed on assets to help them reach their originally anticipated lifespan.</p><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Scheduled maintenance procedures are usually tied to the requirements of the manufacturer's warranty.</p></div><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To keep downtime to a minimum, while still maintaining the asset in such a condition that both use 
    and cost goals are achieved</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Be familiar with the asset's contractual performance requirements.</li><li>Be familiar with the asset manufacturer's warranty requirements, and when necessary incorporate these procedures into the asset's maintenance programs.</li><li>Establish and implement a process that tracks performance to ensure that requirements are met.</li></ol><h4>Preventive maintenance</h4><p>The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to prevent the failure of equipment before it actually occurs. Preventive 
  maintenance is designed to preserve and enhance equipment reliability by replacing worn components before they fail. The 
  ideal preventive maintenance program would prevent all asset failures before they occur. </p><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure the preservation of the useful life of an asset</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Use preventive maintenance when and where it is appropriate.</li><li>Encourage the performance of a cost-benefit analysis before making strategic repairs to assets. The information gleaned could be subsequently incorporated into the decision-making processes on asset disposal.</li></ol><h4>Betterments</h4><p>Betterments consist of any modifications, conversions, upgrades, or additions that enhance or otherwise increase the 
  functionality, efficiency, or capacity of an original asset or one of its component parts.</p><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To enhance the usefulness of an asset</li></ul><h5>Good practice:</h5><ol><li>Conduct a long-term cost-benefit analysis before performing betterments to assets, and incorporate this information into the decision-making processes on asset disposal.</li></ol><p>For further information refer to the following:</p><ul><li>Legislation

          performance assessment and on an economic and program analysis that considers the full life-cycle costs and benefits 
          of alternative solutions to meeting program needs for materiel assets.</li></ul></div><h4>3.4.1 Disposal of government assets</h4><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Disposal</strong> is the process as follows:</p><ul><li>by which an asset has been declared surplusâ€“most assets are disposed of through Crown 
      Assets Distribution (CAD) of Public Works and Government Services Canada (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>) or one of CAD's authorized service providers; and</li><li>that formally removes assets from the department's asset management database when 
      approved transfers to other departments have occurred or when the assets become obsolete. Assets become obsolete under 
      one or more of the following conditions: the spare parts or services are no longer available; the assets cannot be repaired; 
      it is no longer cost-effective or economically feasible to continue with the maintenance and support of the assets; 
      or the assets are no longer required because of changes in operational requirements.</li></ul></div><h5>Objective: </h5><ul><li>To ensure that the disposal of surplus materiel assets is concluded as effectively as possible, as 
    soon as possible after the assets become surplus to the requirements of program delivery, in a manner that obtains highest 
    net value for the Crown, and in compliance with the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12066">Directive on Disposal of Surplus Materiel</a>.</em></li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Refer to the requirements in the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12066">Directive on Disposal of Surplus Materiel</a></em>when disposing of government assets. This Directive sets out specific requirements that departments must meet during the disposal phase of the life cycle of their materiel assets.</li><li>Develop disposal strategies and processes that assess and capture disposal costs, proceeds, and other pertinent historical data that can be made available to programs and operations across the department. Where applicable, departments should involve the <a href="http://biensdelacouronne.tpsgc.gc.ca/mn-eng.cfm">Crown Assets Distribution Directorate (CADD)</a>or one of its private sector service providers as early as possible in the planning process. Departments should consider using a recycling program provided such a program does not circumvent the requirements of the Directive on Disposal of Surplus Materiel.
<h5>Considerations:</h5><ul><li>Consider the life-cycle concepts and cost-benefit analysis. Departments should determine on a case-by-case 
    basis whether a cost-minimizing disposal option is appropriate based on the residual value of the goods.</li><li>Consider the disposal-for-proceeds method as a first choice. Disposal for proceeds includes methods 
    such as sale through CADD or by a CADD private sector provider. </li></ul></li><li>For valuable assets, use a cost-minimizing disposal method (e.g. donation) in exceptional circumstances.</li><li>Recommend that, at a minimum, the chief financial officer (CFO) or an equivalent approve the decision to use a cost-minimizing disposal option.</li><li>Plan and support the decision to dispose of government assets by an informed analysis (that includes reallocation options) of performance indicators, which should present or anticipate future program requirements.</li><li>Ensure that materiel assets are managed and disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with the principles of sustainable development.</li></ol><h5>Considerations:</h5><ul><li>Consider the environmental impact when assessing disposal options.</li></ul><h4><a href="#ComputersForSchoolD">Computers for Schools Program</a></h4><h5>Objectives:</h5><ul><li>To ensure that computer equipment and software programs that are no longer useful in federal departments 
    gain a new and valuable lease on life in Canadian schools</li><li>To help schools take full advantage of the information age by directing surplus computers and related 
    hardware and software programs destined for assets disposal to classrooms across Canada</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Perform the first purge of information from the hard-drive and data storage devices. Departments are responsible for ensuring that security concerns are addressed. Departments can ensure that all hard drives are cleansed using Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)â€“approved software. Details of RCMP information technology security procedures can be found in the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ts-st/pubs/it-ti-sec/g2-003-eng.pdf"><em>Hard Drive Secure Information Removal and Destruction Guidelines</em>(PDF)</a>(<a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ts-st/pubs/it-ti-sec/index-eng.htm">RCMP IT Security Guidelines</a>), and Communications Security Establishment information can be found in <a href="http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf"><em>Clearing and Declassifying Electronic Data Storage Devices</em></a>.</li><li>Do not strip the equipment of vital operating components if it is being offered to the Computers for Schools (<acronym title="Computers for Schools">CFS</acronym>) Program.</li><li>Ensure that, when surplus computer equipment cannot be relocated within the department, all such equipment, including equipment with <a href="#AdaptiveTechnologyD">adaptive technology</a>(AT), is offered to the <a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cfs-ope.nsf/eng/home"><acronym title="Computers for Schools">CFS</acronym>Program</a>.

<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The asset can be made available:
<ol class="lower-roman"><li>gratuitously;</li><li>at <a href="#BookvalueD">book value</a>; or</li><li>at fair market value.</li></ol></li><li>Departments should accurately assess the asset's market value before making the transfer.</li><li>The transfer should appear as follows:
<ol class="lower-roman"><li>a new acquisition to the receiving department;</li><li>a disposal to the transferring department; and</li><li>being in ongoing useâ€“the plans for the asset that were submitted and the performance of the asset that was reported while with one custodian will remain essentially unchanged when the receiving federal custodian takes over.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Arrangements for a transfer of an asset to another department are made directly between the 
    departments involved and normally do not require a Treasury Board submission or the involvement of the CADD.</p></div><h4>Donation of surplus assets</h4><h5>Objective</h5><ul><li>To ensure best value for the Crown</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Make the decision to donate surplus materiel on a case-by-case basis.
<div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Materiel may be donated when the cost of selling an item exceeds the probable proceeds or when the Crown can gain a significant non-monetary benefit. Ministerial authority is required when donating an item for which the proceeds of sale would exceed the disposal costâ€“the agreement of the minister (not a delegated official) in writing is required to make such a donation.</p></div></li><li>Make donations to any of the following:
<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>a Crown corporation, federal agency, provincial government, First Nation, or municipal government in Canada;</li><li>a recognized charity or non-profit organization located in Canada; or</li><li>for locations outside of Canada, to other national governments, treaty organizations of which Canada is a member, or the United Nations.</li></ol><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Donations to individuals or to private sector organizations require the approval of the Treasury Board and Governor in Council (i.e. they require a Treasury Board submission or Order in Council explaining the reasons for such a donation).</p></div></li><li>Surplus low-value assets:
<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Contact functional and technical authorities and the CADD to determine the residual value of surplus movable assets.</li><li>Donate surplus low-value assets where they will receive the greatest use or do the greatest good (to the extent possible).</li><li>Donate surplus low-value assets when a sufficient quantity has been collected.</li><li>Ensure that donations reflect fairness and can withstand public scrutiny.</li></ol><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> The recipient organization(s) should be responsible for all cost(s) associated with the donation, such as pickup and delivery and shipping and handling costs.<br />
Donations are to be made on an as-is-and-where-is basis, and the recipient must sign an agreement that the Crown is forever held blameless of any accident, injury, or other untoward event once the item is received. Departments should seek legal guidance in creating this agreement.</p></div></li></ol><h5>Consideration:</h5><ul><li>When donating low-value surplus movable assets to recipients outside the federal domain, departments 
    shall make sure that recipients are selected in a way the public would perceive as fair, equitable, and transparent.</li></ul><h4>Recycling or destruction</h4><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure best value for the Crown</li></ul><h5>Good practice:</h5><ol><li>Ensure that assets are recycled or destroyed in an environmentally sustainable manner.</li></ol><h4><a href="#DisposalForProceedsD">Disposal for proceeds</a></h4><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure best value for the Crown</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Ensure that assets in this category are disposed of using processes established by the CADD. CADD provides federal departments with disposal services and is the appropriate disposal agent to arrange the sale.</li><li>Ensure that CADD transfers the net proceeds of the sale to the department by interdepartmental settlement and that CADD private sector service providers remit net sale proceeds in accordance with the terms and conditions of their contract or standing offer.</li></ol><h4>Trade-ins</h4><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure best value for the Crown</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Where applicable, ensure that a procurement contract or standing offer agreement (SOA) clearly stipulates the terms and conditions of any trade-in.</li><li>Ensure that appropriate records of trade-in activity are kept for accounting and audit purposes, and ensure that the value of the trade-in is accounted for as the proceeds of disposal.</li></ol><div class="highlightNoBorder"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Trade-ins are not authorized for computer equipment or vehicles.</p></div><h4>Writeoffs</h4><p>A writeoff is the process by which an asset is removed from the departmental inventory. For further details see SectionÂ 4.</p><h4>Writedowns</h4><p>A writedown is the process of reducing the book value of an asset because it is overvalued compared to the fair market 
  value. For further details see SectionÂ 4.</p><h4>Disposal of e-waste</h4><p><em>To be completed in a later version of the Guide.</em></p><h4>Disposal of controlled goods</h4><h5>Objective: </h5><ul><li>To ensure that materiel assets designated as controlled goods, as defined in Part 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/en/D-1"><em>Defence Production Act</em></a>, are given the level of protection

    Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12063">Controlled Goods Directive</a></em></li></ul><h5>Good practice:</h5><ol><li>Refer to the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12063">Controlled Goods Directive</a></em>and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada's <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/index.aspx">Export and Import Controls lists</a>.</li><li>Consult the <a href="http://ssi-iss.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/dmc-cgd/index-eng.html">Controlled Goods Directorate</a>at <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.</li></ol><h4>Disposal of hazardous waste</h4><p>Control of hazardous waste and hazardous recyclable material within Canada is a shared responsibility. The federal government 
  regulates international and interprovincial/territorial movements, while provincial and territorial governments regulate 
  intraprovincial/territorial movements of hazardous waste and hazardous recyclable material. The provinces and territories 
  are also responsible for establishing controls for licensing hazardous waste generators, carriers, and treatment facilities 
  within their jurisdictions.</p><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure the safe disposal of hazardous waste products</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Consult Environment Canada's <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/wmd-dgd/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=FDC36D83-1">Waste Reduction and Management Division</a>for information on hazardous waste products.</li><li>Be aware that, unless the local municipal or city department responsible for waste management has established additional guidelines, policies, and so on, it may be necessary for departments to ascertain the requirements for chemical disposal pursuant to the laws established by the relevant provincial government. Provincial and territorial environment ministry websites may be found on Environment Canada's <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/wmd-dgd/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=7DA57C1E-1">"Related Environmental Agencies"</a>website.</li><li>Be aware that Transport Canada's <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/tdg/menu.htm">Transport Dangerous Goods Directorate</a>is the focal point for the national program to promote public safety during the transportation of dangerous goods. The directorate serves as the major source of regulatory development, information, and guidance on the transportation of dangerous goods for the public, industry, and employees of the government.</li></ol><h5>Considerations:</h5><ul><li>Any department that is disposing of hazardous waste should become familiar with the following:

    to materiel transactions</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Ensure that all materiel transactions are conducted in an open and fair manner. These transactions should recognize the need for the public to be given a reasonable opportunity to access the government and information about the disposal of assets by the government.</li><li>Once a requirement has been identified, ensure that the process of soliciting offers begins promptly, leaving time to consider all viable options. The principle of best value to the Crown should determine which offer is selected, and the factors and criteria that determine the best value should be identified before the solicitation of offers. These criteria must remain constant during the solicitation and selection process.</li><li>When soliciting offers, ensure that a reasonable and representative number of persons or firms are given an opportunity to make offers. Departments can meet that policy requirement by using one of the methods listed below:

<ul><li>public advertising, including an open bidding system;</li><li>public notice that is consistent with generally accepted trade practices;</li><li>selection from an open source list (i.e. a document that lists representative suppliers 
    of the asset required);</li><li>for acquisitions by purchase order, selection from a representative list of available 
    suppliers accompanied by an options analysis that demonstrates a fair comparison of the suppliers on the list; or</li><li>use of a system that, in the minister's opinion, given the subject and nature of 
    the acquisition or disposition, does the following:
    <ol class="lower-roman"><li>provides a reasonable likelihood that potentially interested persons or firms will become aware of the proposed acquisition 
        or disposition; and</li><li>promotes a fair and equitable consideration of offers. </li></ol></li></ul></li></ol></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Valuation"><p><em>Assets have value:</em><strong>Valuation</strong> is the process of estimating the fair market value of an asset. 
  Valuations are required in many contexts, including investment analysis, capital budgeting, acquisition, financial reporting, and litigation.</p><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure that, when conducting transactions, departments determine the likely value of the asset 
    by means of an appraisal or estimate</li></ul><h5>Good practices:</h5><ol><li>Ensure that the process used for valuation results in a reliable, defensible approximation of value with appropriate quality assurance and quality control. The processes and procedures should reflect the level of due diligence appropriate to the potential value and risk involved.</li><li>Before completing a transaction for which an open market does not exist, ensure that the due diligence necessary for the valuation to support the transaction is defensible and, as such, has well-supported data and analysis demonstrating the market value as the performance measurement. The documentation on file must be able to stand the test of public scrutiny.</li></ol><h5>Consideration:</h5><ul><li>Any valuation that has critical or extraordinary assumptions may not be reliable because the value 
    depends on the validity of the assumptions. As such, the valuation analysis may result in a misleading value estimate if 
    the assumptions are not true. The use of extraordinary assumptions is a useful tool for valuation because it allows more 
    options to be considered, typically for budget and planning purposes. If an extraordinary assumption or critical assumption 
    is used as the basis of an estimate of value in support of a transaction, the transaction should not be completed unless 
    the limiting condition or assumption has been satisfied or realized.</li></ul><p>For further information refer to the Treasury Board <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12158">Policy on Allowances for Valuation of Assets and Liabilities</a></em>.</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="5.3 Policy conformity"><h5>Objective:</h5><ul><li>To ensure that all policy requirements are met in all three physical phases of life-cycle materiel
