  4,000 employees.</p><p>1.3 The centre must have the capacity to accommodate at least 30 children.</p><p>1.4 A centre must attempt to operate with all or most of its capacity used by children of employees. After the initial 
  five years of operation, the rental subsidy calculation will be based on the percentage of children of employees using

  within six months unless the deputy minister writes to the secretary within that period, indicating that as a result of 
  the economic viability assessment, a centre will be established. (See policy requirement 2.4)</p><p>2.2 Ensure that:</p><ul><li>No other actual or proposed centre already serves any of the identified federal work force; </li><li>Requirements 1.2 
    and 1.3 are met.</li></ul><p>2.3 Survey the identified federal workforce, including determining the official languages needs of interested employees 
  (i.e. English, French, bilingual) and conduct a thorough financial analysis to establish whether current and future demands 
  are sufficient for a centre to be viable.</p><p>2.4 Where the deputy head is satisfied that a centre is financially viable and that the department is willing to be 
  the lead department, he or she advises the appropriate custodian department and the Secretary of the Treasury Board that

The custodian department responsible for the worksite must:</p><div class="indent1"><p>3.1 determine whether an operationally practicable location for a centre exists;</p><p>3.2 board and the lead department, identify an economically suitable location within or near a federal workplace for which 
  fit-up costs will not exceed $400,000 (1991 dollars) and plan the fit-up of the centre;</p><p>3.3 ensure that the fit-up complies with the legal requirements for licensed day care centres in the area where the 
  centre is to be located;</p><p>3.4 ensure that the centre is accessible to parents and children with disabilities;</p><p>3.5 verify that the corporation has received the appropriate provincial or municipal licences or both; and</p><p>3.6 in entering into a licence agreement with the corporation for the use of the space allocated to the centre, obtain 
  legal advice with respect to the proposed agreement on matters relating thereto, including the issues of liability and 
  of ensuring conformity with this policy. The agreement must include provision for: payment of rent by the corporation 
  of not less than that set out in appendix B and, if applicable, meeting the language requirements in appendix D.</p></div></section><section anchor="4.4" title="Day care centre corporation"><p>4.

capacity used by children of employees. However, in the initial 'operation, Public Service demand may not be sufficient 
to fill the required spaces.</p><p>In recognition of these factors, new day care centres created under the permanent policy will receive the full employer 
rent subsidy for the first five (5) years of operation, as follows:</p><section anchor="B.1" title="1. Grace period"><p>The percentage of usage of facilities by children of Public Service employees during years 1 and 2 of the day care 'operation 
is not taken into consideration.</p></section><section anchor="B.2" title="2. Monitoring period"><p>Over years 3, 4 and 5, day care centre corporations monitor the percentage of their facilities being used by children 
of Public Service employees, in anticipation of the rent reduction formula which comes into effect at the beginning of year 
6. Day care corporations should target to achieve a three-year running average of 70 per cent occupancy by children of Public 
Service employees over this time.</p><p>At the beginning of year 6 and of every year thereafter, the day care corporation calculates the average percentage of 
the 'usage by children of Public Service employees over the previous three years.</p><p>When the three-year average works out at 70 per cent or above, the full employer rent subsidy is maintained. When the 
three-year average is below 70 per cent, the rent subsidy is reduced in proportion to the percentage of space used by children 
of Public Service employees (please consult chart).</p><p>The amount of rent equivalent to the percentage of the rent subsidy reduction will be payable by the day care corporation 
on the first day of the third month of the new year, starting in year 6.</p><p>A centre that has a proportion of usage by the children of employees of less than 20 per cent receives no subsidy.</p><table class="rpp widthFull"><caption><strong>Rent subsidy table (Three year average)</strong></caption><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTopCenter"><strong>Percentage federal employee
