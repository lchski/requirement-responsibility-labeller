Definitions"><p>Definitions to be used in the interpretation of this guideline are listed in the <a href="#appA">Appendix.</a></p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Principles"><p>The Government of Canada, for the most part, underwrites its own risks and does not purchase insurance in the commercial
insurance market. "Underwriting" risk requires the following:</p><ul><li>thorough risk analysis;</li><li>acceptance of risk; and</li><li>identification of all financial options in order to ensure that losses can be funded if they occur.</li></ul><p>Underwriting risk is the responsibility of each department, much in the same manner as is
practising risk management under the <em>Framework for the Management of Risk.</em>
The term   "self-insurance" refers to the practice of each department funding
its own losses. An important distinction is that "self-insurance" connotes a
business approach to loss funding, namely that the Department acts as if it
were its own insurer by:</p><ul><li>understanding the nature of the risk;</li><li>making funds readily available in the event of a loss; and</li><li>having controls in place to reduce the financial impact once the loss has occurred.</li></ul><p>The Government of Canada may, from time to time, exercise the option to purchase insurance in
the commercial insurance market to finance certain risks. Examples of these
exceptions to the practice of self-insurance include the following:</p><ul><li>Operations in foreign jurisdictions that face
    mandatory requirements for insurance coverage, such as the operation of motor
    vehicles;</li><li>The interests of the Government co-mingled with those
    of other parties and the purchase of insurance constitutes an economy of scale
    that effectively protects all parties (e.g., Public Private Partnerships); and</li><li>Insurance coverage provided as part of expertise
    in service contracts, such as removal (e.g., moving and transfer) services for
    employees' personal property.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Management practices"><p>Managers are responsible for analyzing financial risks
when considering the purchase of insurance, pursuant to the Principles section
of this guideline and the <em>Framework of the Management of Risk</em>.  In such
cases, a cost-benefit analysis should be carried out in order to validate the
decision to purchase insurance. Note that Order in Council 1030, issued in 1881,
stated that it is a "wise economy for the government to underwrite its own
risks, as well as on moveable as on immoveable property... and no new ones
effected". In 1927, this Order in Council was extended to include "automobiles
etc".</p><p><strong>Acquisition of commercial insurance</strong></p><p>5.1 In cases where managers have determined that the purchase of insurance presents
an effective risk underwriting strategy and value for money, managers should
ensure that:</p><ul><li>legal services are consulted, in order to identify any legal
    implications arising from the purchase of insurance and whether or not doing so
    creates any potential liabilities for Canada;</li><li>other government departments with similar requirements are
    consulted so that any opportunities for insurance coverage and cost sharing are
    explored; and</li><li>officials of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) are
  consulted for guidance on the insurance procurement and management process.</li></ul><p>5.2 For additional guidance on insurance coverage for fleet-managed vehicles, note that the 
<a href="/mm-gm/doc/gfm-ggpa/c1-00-eng.aspx"><em>Guide to Fleet Management, Chapter 1: Light Duty Vehicles</em></a> and 
<a href="/mm-gm/doc/gfm-ggpa/c2-00-eng.aspx"><em>Guide to Fleet Management, Chapter 2: Executive Vehicles</em></a> apply.</p><p>For additional direction on insurance coverage for employees and
vehicles while on government business travel, note that the National
Joint Council <a href="http://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/travel-voyage/index-eng.php"><em>Travel Directive</em></a> applies.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Roles and responsibilities of other organizations"><p>This section identifies other significant departments with respect to this guideline. In and of itself, it
does not confer any authority.</p><p>6.1 The <strong>Department of Justice Canada</strong> is responsible for providing
advice regarding government responsibilities and legal obligations where
proposed investments, actions or policies might result in serious exposure in
situations of risk.</p><p>6.2 The <strong>Treasury Board Secretariat</strong> is responsible for the
development, oversight and maintenance of this guideline and for providing
interpretative advice.  It is also responsible for Risk Management, Contracting/Procurement policies and Fleet Management policy
instruments.</p><p>6.3 <strong>Public Works and Government Services Canada</strong> (PWGSC) is
responsible for providing advice and guidance on the insurance requirements of
contracts for goods, services, construction, building services and leases.</p><p>6.4 The <strong>Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer</strong> is responsible
for interpretation of fundamental or complex issues relating to safety and
health of employees. It is also responsible for the Travel policy instruments
and National Joint Council Foreign Service, Relocation and Isolated Posts and
Government Housing Directives.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7.
