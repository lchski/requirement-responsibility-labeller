Context"><p><strong>3.1</strong> Learning, training, leadership development and professional development are key to ensuring that the public service is equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The acquisition of skills and knowledge and the development of managerial and leadership know‑how is critical for the effective management of the public service—it is the foundation of a responsive, accountable and innovative government.</p><p><strong>3.2</strong> Deputy heads have the authority, pursuant to section 12(1)(a) of the <em>Financial Administration 
Act</em>, to "determine the learning, training and development requirements of persons employed in the public service and fix the terms on which the learning, training and development may be carried out," and Treasury Board has the authority, pursuant to section 11.1(1)(f) to "establish policies or issue directives respecting the exercise of the powers granted by this Act to deputy heads..."</p><p><strong>3.3</strong> This policy supports deputy heads in meeting their responsibilities by addressing specific training requirements for four groups of employees: new employees, managers at all levels and functional specialists in domains defined by the employer and all employees where the Treasury Board has determined training to be mandatory in the best interests of the public service. In addition, it introduces measures to strengthen organizational leadership and promote innovation. Implementation of this policy will help build a learning culture in the Public Service of Canada and stimulate, guide and promote its development as a learning organization.</p><p><strong>3.4</strong> With associated directives, it establishes a coherent approach to learning to ensure the ongoing development of individual capacity, strong organizational leadership and innovative management practices. </p><p><strong>3.5</strong> This policy reflects the government’s commitment to ensuring that Canadians are served by a skilled, well-trained, professional workforce and it recognizes that foundational learning is required within the public service in support of this objective. It fosters the value of strong organizational leadership based on forward-looking management practices and continuous improvements in performance.</p><p><strong>3.6</strong> Learning is a shared responsibility of employees, managers at all levels, deputy heads and the employer. Employees are responsible for acquiring and maintaining the knowledge, skills and competencies related to their level and functions, and for developing and pursuing learning plans that are aligned with departmental business priorities and prepare them to do the next job. Managers at all levels and deputy heads are responsible for ensuring the timely completion of training that supports departmental priorities and the government’s management improvement objectives, and the best interests of the public service. Treasury Board in its role as the employer establishes the knowledge needed in areas deemed necessary for effective management of the public service.</p><p><strong>3.7</strong> This policy respects the relevant provisions stipulated in the <em>Official Languages Act</em>, the related regulations and applicable Treasury Board policies. This policy is issued pursuant to paragraph 11.1(1)(f) of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>.</p><p><strong>3.8</strong> It is essential that this policy be implemented in conjunction with the:
