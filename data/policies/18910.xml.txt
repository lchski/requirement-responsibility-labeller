Effective Date"><p>1.1 
This standard takes effect on June 1, 2010.  The standard will apply
only when new investments or significant upgrades in EDRM solutions are proposed.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 
Thisstandard
applies to departments as defined in section 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/" title="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration
Act (FAA)</em></a>, unless excluded by specific acts, regulations or
Orders in Council.</p><p>2.2 
Those portions of sections 6.2.1, 6.2.2, and 7.1 relating to the role of
the Treasury Board Secretariat in monitoring compliance and directing
consequences for non-compliance do not apply with respect to the Office of the
Auditor General, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Office of the
Information Commissioner, the Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, the Office
of the Commissioner of Lobbying, the Office of the Commissioner of Official
Languages and the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner.  The

instruments that address the management of compliance.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 
This standard supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742"><em>Policy on
Information Management</em></a> and <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755"><em>Policy on Management
of Information Technology</em></a> by outlining information management (IM) and
information technology (IT) requirements for the departmental IM Senior
Official and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or equivalent in the area of Electronic
Document and Records Management (EDRM) solutions. </p><p>3.2 
Information resources of business value are strategic assets used across
government to support effective decision making and facilitate ongoing
operations and the delivery of programs and services.  The Directive on
Recordkeeping requires departments to establish the mechanisms and tools to
support the departmental recordkeeping requirements throughout the information
life cycle.</p><p>3.3 
EDRM solutions are automated systems used to manage, protect and
preserve information resources from creation to disposition.  These solutions
maintain appropriate contextual information (metadata) and enable organizations
to access, use and dispose of records (i.e., their retention, destruction or
transfer) in a managed, systematic and auditable way in order to ensure
accountability, transparency and meet departmental business objectives.</p><p>3.4 
EDRM solutions may be a part of a suite of products that, along with effective
policies and practices, enable a department-wide approach to information
management that improves the quality and reliability of information for
decision-making, improves services to managers and employees, and reduces
inefficiencies, duplication and costs.  </p><p>3.5 
Through the implementation of government-wide IM business processes and
practices and the use of government-wide procurement options in support of EDRM
solutions, the government will see a reduction in the overall cost of service
delivery.</p><p>3.6 
Investment decisions to acquire EDRM solutions resulting from government-wide
procurement activities may be combined with other departmental solutions to
provide a more comprehensive product suite.</p><p>3.7 
EDRM solutions enable GC employees to find, share and collaboratively
develop information resources of business value, therefore increasing their
productivity, and the efficiency and effectiveness of their departments.</p><p>3.8 
This standard is issued pursuant to section 7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration
Act</a>.</p><p>3.9
