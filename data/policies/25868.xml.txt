analysis that will be evaluated to support requests for
capacity-based approval limits and conditions for real property
transactions. Such limits and conditions should be based on
operational needs and departmental capacity to manage transactional
risks, complexities and sensitivities. Requests for such limits
should present an analysis of operational need; an understanding of
the risks, complexities and sensitivities associated with typical
transactions undertaken by the department;<a href="#fn1" name="fnr1" id="fnr1"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span><sup>1</sup></a> and demonstrate internal
capacity to manage the identified risks, complexities and
sensitivities. This guide will assist departments in presenting the
information necessary to support being granted these approval
limits.</p></section><section anchor="1-2" title="1.2  Background"><p>A real property transaction can be an acquisition or disposition
of real property by purchase, lease, licence, exchange, gift,
easement, expropriation, transfer or acceptance of administration,
or transfer or acceptance of administration and control.</p><p>Ministers have the authority to acquire or dispose of real
property under the <em>Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables
Act</em>, the <em>Federal Real Property Regulations</em> or other
acts. Generally, real property is acquired or disposed using the
<em>Regulations</em>' authority unless there is a more specific
legislative authority. The approvals required for real property
transactions are dependent on the legislative authority used to
undertake the transaction.</p><p>The <em>Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act</em>
provides authority to the Treasury Board to "establish financial or
other limits, restrictions or requirements respecting any
transaction or class of transactions authorized under regulations
made pursuant to subsection (2)." Treasury Board first established
transaction approval limits in 1992. Real property transaction
approval limits and conditions can be financial thresholds for
specific types of transactions or conditions such as specific
processes that must be followed or a combination of both.</p><p>These limits are important because when acquiring or disposing
of real property using the authority of the <em>Regulations</em>, a
minister must seek Treasury Board approval when the value of the
transaction is greater than the transaction approval limits for his
or her department. If the value of the transaction is less than the
department's transaction approval limits, he or she can undertake
the transaction without seeking Treasury Board approval. If a
minister acquires or disposes of real property under the
<em>Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act</em>,
Governor-in-Council approval is required, regardless of the value
of the transaction. If a minister acquires or disposes of real
property under any other act, the specific requirements or
restrictions detailed in the authorizing legislation must be
followed. Therefore, even those transactions that are within the
limits established by Treasury Board may require Treasury Board or
Governor-in-Council approval.</p><p>In 2006, the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy on
Management of Real Property</a></em> was renewed, and limits and
conditions that were approved before that date were embedded in
Appendix B of the policy. Limits were categorized as either special
or general. Special limits were department-specific, and general
limits applied to all other departments. The real property
transaction approval limits were then reviewed in 2010. As a result
of this analysis, it was determined that the existing limits needed
to be renewed in order to be coherent and consistent with
departmental capacity. Therefore, the Treasury Board of Canada
Secretariat proposed, in consultation with custodial departments,
that the existing limits be rescinded and that departments be asked
to seek Treasury Board approval of revised limits, based on a
consistent analysis of need and capacity.</p><p>On November 17, 2011, all existing limits and conditions were
removed from policy and placed in a <a href="/rpm-gbi/doc/talc-lcap/talc-lcap-eng.asp">Web-based repository</a>. Most
special limits that were established before November 17, 2011, will
expire on November 17, 2014, and departments that do not seek
revised special limits before November 17, 2014, will revert to
general limits. If departments or agencies want to undertake real
property transactions above the general limits without needing to
seek Treasury Board approval, they are encouraged to seek
capacity-based limits. This guide has been developed to assist
departments with such requests.</p><p>Special and general real property transaction approval limits
and conditions that have been approved by the Treasury Board are
posted in the <a href="/rpm-gbi/doc/talc-lcap/talc-lcap-eng.asp">Web-based repository</a>.</p></section><section anchor="1-3" title="1.3  Link With Priorities"><p>Requests and recommendations for capacity-based transaction
approval limits and conditions will be evaluated to align with
several overarching objectives. First and foremost, transaction
approval limits should be based on departmental capacity to manage
identified risks, complexities and sensitivities and meet
operational needs. Furthermore, the tools and processes for
seeking, retaining and publishing transaction approval limits are
designed to reduce the "web of rules," reinforce deputy head
accountability, reduce departmental reporting burden, and promote
principles-based policies.</p></section><section anchor="1-4" title="1.4  Operational Need"><p>Capacity-based transaction approval limits and conditions should
support the operational needs of the department; requests for such
limits should therefore be supported by an analysis of departmental
need. In order to determine the needs of the department, the
submission should include an analysis of past transactions and
estimate the nature, volume and value of transactions anticipated
over the next three years. The analysis of past transactions is
also used as an indication of the typical transactions undertaken
by the department. If future transactions are expected to be
markedly different from those in the past, the risks, sensitivities
and complexities of anticipated future transactions should also be
identified and analyzed.</p></section><section anchor="1-5" title="1.5  Risks, Complexities and Sensitivities"><p>Many real property transactions contain inherent risks,
sensitivities and complexities. Requests for capacity-based
transaction approval limits should include an analysis of such
risks that are inherent in past transactions undertaken by the
department. The objective of this analysis is for departments to
demonstrate that they are able to identify and assess the unique
risks, complexities and sensitivities inherent to their typical
transactions.</p><p>There are any number of circumstances that may carry inherent
issues. Acquisitions that could be considered sensitive include
long-term leases, the acquisition of heritage properties, the
acquisition of contaminated sites or other transactions that
introduce Crown liability, acquisitions that are not at market
value, sole source acquisitions, land assemblies and others.
Disposals that could be considered sensitive are the disposal of
heritage properties, properties that have competing interests,
contaminated sites, properties that have redevelopment potential,
properties wanted by other departments or levels of government,
directed disposals, strategic disposals, and disposals at less than
market value. Other conditions that may contribute to a transaction
that is complex or sensitive include those that touch on
inter-jurisdictional relations, those that have a high degree of
public or media interest, those that may infringe on established or
asserted Aboriginal rights, and those that are part of a
public-private partnership.</p><p>Another means of assessing sensitivity and complexity of past
transactions is to analyze transactions based on policy
requirements. The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy on
Management of Real Property</a></em>, the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12043">Directive on
the Sale or Transfer of Surplus Real Property</a></em>, the
<em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12044">Accessibility
Standard for Real Property</a></em>, and <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12045">Appraisals and
Estimates Standard for Real Property</a></em> impose requirements
that govern real property transactions. Transactions should be
assessed against these requirements. Departments are required to
comply with Treasury Board real property policy principles,
including open and fair transactions, paying and charging based on
market value, and achieving best value to the Crown.</p><p>It is critical to note that just because a department may
typically undertake transactions that have identified risks,
sensitivities and complexities, it does not mean that these
particular transactions will require Treasury Board approval. The
intent of the review is to ensure that the department has the
ability to identify the real property transaction risks,
sensitivities and complexities, and establish mechanisms to manage
the risks, sensitivities and complexities that the department is
likely to face in its operations.</p></section><section anchor="1-6" title="1.6  Departmental Capacity"><p>Departments will need to demonstrate they have the tools in
place to manage the risks, sensitivities and complexities of their
typical transactions. These tools include appropriate governance
structures such as approval processes and delegation of authority,
documented rules and guidance, and monitoring mechanisms to verify
that governance structures and internal policies are followed.</p><p>The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy on
Management of Real Property</a></em> requires departments to have a
comprehensive real property management framework. The management
framework should govern management practices and real property
transactions and should be tailored based on the needs of the
department. Table 1 outlines the elements of a real property
management framework.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="widthFull"><caption class="alignLeft"><strong>Table 1.

departmental and federal goals, and the planning process should
reveal that decisions for real property transactions are based on
an analysis of program need and real property performance. It is
recommended that when departments request capacity-based
transaction approval limits, the submission should highlight
internal planning processes for managing real property
transactions. For example, this may include business cases, options
analysis, communications plans and stakeholder analysis.</p><p>Using the real property management framework as a guide,
departments should indicate that authorities to undertake
transactions are documented and that decision-making structures are
in place. Practitioners should have a clear understanding of their
authority and the approvals that are needed to proceed. The roles
of Justice Canada and Public Works and Government Services Canada
(PWGSC), among others, should be clear so that practitioners know
how and when these departments are engaged. It should be noted that
if the authority to undertake transactions is delegated broadly,
and there should be detailed guidance, approval protocols and
monitoring mechanisms. The department should outline how risks,
complexities and sensitivities inherent in real property
transactions are identified, mitigated and managed as part of the
planning and approval process. The approval process should indicate
that risky, complex or sensitive transactions are elevated for
senior management oversight and approval.</p><h4>1.6.2  Rules and Guidance</h4><p>Rules, policies, checklists and other documents that guide
transaction decisions should be in place. Guidance could include a
policy on open and fair transactions that articulates when it is or
is not necessary to have a public solicitation. There should also
be written guidance that details how to complete options and
financial analyses of real property transactions and that directs
how to establish and confirm the amount given or received for the
acquisition or disposition of real property.</p><p>There should also be internal guidance that details how to
identify and manage sensitive transactions. For example, this could
include a guide to conduct stakeholder analyses and how and when to
inform interested parties of the Crown's intention to acquire or
dispose of real property. Of importance is that departmental
policies and guidance provide sufficient information to
practitioners so they can apply judgment consistently.</p><h4>1.6.3  Monitoring</h4><p>The last element of capacity that should be demonstrated is
monitoring. Departments should have mechanisms in place to monitor
transactions to confirm that decisions and approvals align with
departmental and Treasury Board policies, respect authority limits,
and meet internal approval requirements.</p></section><section anchor="1-7" title="1.7  Requests for Capacity-Based Limits"><p>Requests for capacity-based transaction approval limits and
conditions can be either financial or descriptive in nature, or a
combination of both. It is recognized that the dollar value of a
transaction is not always the most appropriate or accurate measure
of the risk, complexity or sensitivity associated with a
transaction. It is also recognized that the majority of
transactions undertaken in some departments can be categorized or
classified accurately, based on the nature of the transaction,
method of solicitation, or the party with whom the Crown transacts.
For this reason, the request for capacity-based limits and
conditions can be either financial or descriptive, or a combination
of both, based on the needs and capacity of the department seeking
capacity-based limits.</p><h4>1.7.1  Treasury Board Submission</h4><p>Section 16(4) of the <em>Federal Real Property and Federal
Immovables Act</em> provides authority to the Treasury Board to
"establish financial or other limits, restrictions or requirements
respecting any transaction or class of transactions authorized
under regulations made pursuant to subsection (2)." Therefore, all
requests for capacity-based transaction approval limits must be
established through a Treasury Board submission. This can be in the
form of a stand-alone submission or as part of the submission
seeking approval of the department's investment plan and project
management capacity. If the request for capacity-based transaction
approval limits and conditions is included as part of the
submission seeking approval of the department's investment plan,
the information and analysis in support of revised limits should be
included in a supporting appendix to the submission.</p><p>Tools and resources are in place to assist departments in
developing Treasury Board submissions. <em><a href="/pubs_pol/opepubs/TBM_162/gptbs-gppct-eng.pdf">
A Guide to Preparing Treasury Board Submissions</a></em> provides
general guidance. Section II of this guide further outlines how to
prepare a Treasury Board submission seeking capacity-based real
property transaction approval limits.</p></section><section anchor="1-8" title="1.8  Reporting"><p>Reporting requirements for real property transactions will be
managed through the <a href="/dfrp-rbif/home-accueil-eng.aspx"><em>Directory of Federal Real Property</em></a> (DFRP), and there
will be minor modifications made to the system and the guide to
require that the date of all transactions be entered into the DFRP.
By having the dates of real property transactions, the Treasury
Board of Canada Secretariat will be able to monitor policy
compliance and have a more accurate account of the real property
transactions completed.</p></section><section anchor="1-9" title="1.9  Ongoing Capacity"><p>The newly obtained capacity-based limits and conditions will not
expire. However, because capacity is not static, departments that
have capacity-based limits will be required to regularly reaffirm
that their capacity continues. It is expected that departments will
reaffirm capacity to manage real property transactions using a
capacity attestation that will be submitted by the deputy head to
the Secretariat within three years of receiving approval of
capacity-based limits.</p><p>Consultations will be held with custodial departments shortly on
the form, content and workings of the attestation.</p><p>If a department fails to attest to ongoing capacity, or if the
Secretariat does not agree with the attestation, the Secretariat
may recommend to the Treasury Board that the capacity-based limits
be reduced or rescinded.</p><p>A department can prepare a submission to request revised
capacity-based limits at any time, should its operational needs and
capacity change. The capacity attestation will be used only to
monitor the limits previously approved by the Treasury Board; any
amendments to limits, other than adjustments to account for
inflation, must be approved by the Treasury Board, based on an
analysis presented in a Treasury Board submission.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2.0  Submission Structure"><p>A <a href="/tbsf-fsct/300-1-eng.asp">Treasury Board
submission template</a> is available on the Publiservice
website.</p><section anchor="2-1" title="2.1  Subject"><p>The subject of the Treasury Board submission should be "Request
for capacity-based real property transaction approval limits and
conditions."</p></section><section anchor="2-2" title="2.2  Authority"><p>The authority cited in the submission should be the <em>Federal
Real Property and Federal Immovables Act</em>, section 16(4).</p></section><section anchor="2-3" title="2.3  Proposal"><p>The proposal should begin with the following: "The Minister of
[insert] is seeking Treasury Board approval for capacity-based real
property transaction approval limits as follows."</p><p>The wording should be as clear as possible because when the
submission is approved, the approved proposal will be published in
the Treasury Board repository of Real Property Transaction Approval
Limits and Conditions. For financial limits, the revised limits
should clearly indicate the type of transaction corresponding to
the financial limits. Types of transactions include acquisition by
purchase, lease, acceptance of administration, or acceptance of
administration and control or disposition by sale, gift, lease out,
transfer of administration, or transfer of administration and
control and others. Conditions could include specific processes
that will be followed or specific parties with which the minister
will transact, such as other government departments.</p></section><section anchor="2-4" title="2.4  Cost and Source of Funds"><p>Note whether there are any new resources required to implement
this initiative; however, this should be nil.</p></section><section anchor="2-5" title="2.5  Audit and Evaluation"><p>The purpose of this section is to provide a sense of the
conclusions of previous audits and evaluations relevant to the
proposal, as well as a brief description of future plans in these
areas. If there are no previous or future audits or evaluations at
play, the organization should simply state, "Not applicable."</p></section><section anchor="2-6" title="2.6  Remarks"><h4>2.6.1  Real Property Context</h4><p>The objective of this section is to outline information
necessary to situate the departmental request for capacity-based
transaction approval limits and conditions. This section should be
brief and include only the information necessary to situate the
request. Some of the information that should be presented in the
real property context is captured in the <em><a href="/dfrp-rbif/home-accueil-eng.aspx">
Directory of Federal Real Property.</a></em> The context could
include the following:</p><ul><li>A summary of the department's real property portfolio;</li><li>The number of buildings or properties owned and leased;</li><li>The primary use of real property holdings and the typical number of acquisitions and dispositions;</li><li>The business drivers for real property transactions; and</li><li>Challenges facing the department when it needs to acquire or dispose of real property.</li></ul><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h4>Tip</h4><p>The <a href="/dfrp-rbif/home-accueil-eng.aspx">Directory of Federal Real Property</a> (DFRP) is the central real property inventory system of the Government of Canada. It contains data on key characteristics of the real property held in support of government programs. Custodial departments submit information to the DFRP annually and certify its accuracy and completeness.</p></div><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h5>Review Checklist: Real Property Context</h5><ul><li>Does the submission present a summary of the
        department's portfolio? What is the composition and size of
        the departmental portfolio (i.e., number of properties and
        buildings and the number of owned and leased holdings)?</li><li>Does the submission present the operational
        imperatives that necessitate the acquisition and disposition
        of real property?</li><li>Does the submission present the primary use of the
        department's real property holdings?</li><li>Does the submission present the department's
        primary real property partners (e.g., provinces,
        municipalities, Aboriginal peoples, private landlords,
        universities)?</li><li>Does the submission present the business drivers
        for real property transactions?</li><li>Does the submission include any unique factors
        that help explain the nature of the department's real
        property transactions?</li><li>Does the submission outline the implications if
        the department does not receive the requested transaction
        approval limits?</li></ul></div><h4>2.6.2  Operational Need</h4><p>This
section should present both a description and an analysis of real
property transactions typically undertaken by the department. This
section serves to provide a background of departmental
transactions, helps demonstrate future departmental requirements,
and helps identify that the department has the capacity to identify
and analyze the risks, sensitivities and complexities of its
typical transactions.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h5>Tip</h5><p>When an analysis is requested, the expectation is that it will identify and break down the subject matter to identify issues, trends, challenges, risks and insights.</p></div><h5>2.6.2.1  Past Transactions</h5><p>This section should include a description and analysis of past
transactions within the past three years. It should also present
the total number of transactions, the number and type of
acquisitions and dispositions, and generally the total
consideration paid or received.</p><p>The analysis should present the number of transactions that were
undertaken using departmental approval limits, those undertaken by
PWGSC on behalf of the department, and those that required Treasury
Board approval. This section should also present an analysis of the
method of acquisition and disposition and the associated
processes.</p><p>It is critical to note that departments are not expected to
provide an exhaustive inventory and description of all transactions
undertaken. Information provided in this section should be more
analytical in nature.</p><h5>2.6.2.2  Risks, Complexities and Sensitivities</h5><p>As outlined in section 1.5, many real property transactions
contain inherent risks, sensitivities and complexities. Departments
should provide an analysis of such characteristics of the typical
transactions they undertake. The purpose of this analysis is to
show that the department is able to identify and assess these
characteristics in its own transactions. Transactions should also
be assessed against policy requirements.</p><p>Although this analysis of typical transactions should generally
focus on transactions undertaken in the past, if future
transactions are expected to be markedly different from those in
the past, the risks, sensitivities and complexities of projected
future transactions should also be identified and analyzed.</p><h5>2.6.2.3  Future Transactions</h5><p>In order to assess future departmental needs, departments are
advised to describe transactions that are expected to be completed
in the next three years. It is recognized that it is not possible
to forecast the total number and type of transactions in detail;
however, departments should identify the number of known
transactions, leases that will expire, surplus sites, and the
estimated number and nature of expected transactions based on
operational needs. The aim of this analysis is to determine the
transaction approval limits needed to support anticipated
transactions over the next several years. This section should also
estimate the number of transactions that will be undertaken using
capacity-based departmental approval limits and those that will
still require Treasury Board approval.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h6>Review Checklist: Real Property Transactions</h6><ul><li>Does the submission present the number of

department has in place to manage real property transactions and
support requests for capacity-based transaction approval limits.
Specific tools for managing real property transactions include
governance, rules and guidance, and monitoring. Section 1.6
provides additional context and clarification that relate to these
tools. The submission should address each of the tools identified
in the following.</p><p>Requests for capacity-based limits should be based on
operational need and the capacity to manage risks, complexities and
sensitivities associated with departmental real property
transactions. If a department identifies real property
transactional capacity gaps, these should be outlined and analyzed
and include a plan to address the gaps noted.</p><h5>2.6.3.1  Governance</h5><p>This should include a description of the analysis completed for
planning transactions, such as business cases and options analysis,
and how planned transactions are captured in departmental planning
documents such as the Investment Plan. Departments should indicate
the approval bodies and delegation of authority instruments used in
the management and approval of real property transactions and how
organizational structures mitigate transactional risks and
sensitivities. The department should also note whether it has
completed transactions in excess of limits without the prior
consent of the Treasury Board and under what circumstances.</p><h5>2.6.3.2  Rules and Guidance</h5><p>Departments should present internal guidance governing real
property transactions, such as internal policies, guidelines and
checklists, and indicate how they are disseminated and whether they
are regularly updated to account for changes in practices.
Transactional risk, complexities and sensitivities identified in
the transaction analysis section should have corresponding guidance
that is available, widely distributed and used by
practitioners.</p><h5>2.6.3.3  Monitoring</h5><p>This section should present how real property transactions are
monitored so that senior management is satisfied that practices
align with written guidance and approval requirements.</p><div class="lightgreyBG borderSimple"><h6>Review Checklist: Capacity Assessment</h6><ul><li>Does the submission present current planning
