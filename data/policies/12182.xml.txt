  closed to a separate equity account (FRA 31224- Endowment accounts). As a result, an additional journal entry (1e) was 
  added to Scenario B, Journal Entry 1 and the FRA Coding Rationale was modified. As well, the Introduction section - "Accounting

  and Scenario B, Journal Entry 1 to accommodate the change.
  <p>As well, when portions of the transfer payment are to be repaid, the credit will be to 
  Transfer Payment expense (FRA 511XX) instead of revenue (FRA 42719) and the Accounts receivable (FRA 11221) will be replaced

  by objects;</li><li>assist departmental staff in recording both routine and complex transactions particular to government, from the accrual, 
  authorities and object of expenditure perspective. This is important since all accounting transactions must be recorded 
  to indicate: a) accrual accounting basis; b) appropriations or other authorities basis; and, c) object of expenditure 
  basis; and,</li><li>assist departments with respect to recognition and disclosure requirements for the production of their departmental 
  financial statements on a full accrual basis.</li></ul></section><section anchor="1.2" title="1.2 Limitation of Manual"><p>It should be noted that the Manual does not purport to cover all possible accounting transactions and Scenario s. This 
is considered to be neither desirable nor possible because of the number of permutations and combinations that can exist. 
This is especially so for the use of authority codes because they depend to a great extent on specific departmental legislation 
and other authorities including Estimates. As a result, the Manual cannot be considered authoritative.</p><p>The transactions presented must be considered in light of this and may not be the only possible way of handling a specific 
transaction. Thus, the Manual only provides general direction on the majority of transactions that Departments will encounter. 
However, the transactions covered together with the explanations should provide departmental personnel with the necessary 
guidance to handle most transactions. In circumstances where this is not possible, the advice of TBS should be sought.</p><p>To use this Manual effectively, departmental personnel should refer to:</p><ul><li>the

When there are any conflicts between this manual and legislation or regulations or policy, the latter will apply.</p></section><section anchor="1.4" title="1.4 Description of Accrual Accounting, Accounting for Appropriations and Other Authorities and &#xA;Reporting by Objects"><p>With the full implementation of the Financial Information Strategy on 1 April 2001, departments will be required to account 
for economic events specific to their department on: a) an accrual accounting basis; b) an authority basis to identify the 
appropriations or other authorities; and, c) an objects of expenditure basis. Although there may be similarities amongst 
these three requirements, there are many differences. Consequently, they will be considered separately.</p><p>The underlying bases of accounting differ to some extent between accrual accounting and appropriation accounting. Currently 
appropriations are on a partial accrual basis. Consequently, reporting in financial statements will need to be on both a 
full accrual accounting and partial accrual accounting bases. Under the partial accrual basis now used for amounts reported 
in the Estimates, some expenses are accrued but not all; respendable revenues are on a pure cash basis; and, non-financial 
assets are expensed on acquisition. For example, Payables at Year End (PAYE) are accrued, as are salaries, while other items 
like employee benefits are not accrued. Transactions that get recorded on an accrual accounting basis may or may not affect 
appropriations and vice versa. In these cases, the appropriate coding and journal entries must be made to ensure that appropriations 
are not improperly affected. Departments will also be required to record transactions on an object of expenditure basis. 
It is best to consider these three elements i.e., accrual, authority and objects as separate and distinct since there are 
many circumstances where there is not a direct correlation amongst or between them.</p><h4>1.4.1 Accrual Accounting</h4><p>Accrual accounting recognizes transactions when the underlying economic event occurs, not just when cash is received 
or paid. In accrual accounting, transactions are classified as assets, liabilities, equity, revenues or expenses.</p><p>The objective of accrual accounting is to ensure that events that affect a department's financial statements are recorded 
in the periods in which they occur, rather than in the periods in which the department uses its appropriation. Accrual accounting 
means recognizing revenue when earned (rather than when cash is received) and recognizing expenses when incurred (rather 
than just when paid). Over the long run, trends in expenses and revenues, since they reflect the underlying economic consequences 
of operating decisions for a time period are generally more meaningful than trends in payments and cash receipts or charges 
to an appropriation.</p><p>The accrual basis provides users with information about such matters as the resources controlled by the department, the 
cost of its operations and other information useful in assessing its financial position and changes in it over a particular 
time period, and in assessing whether a particular organization is operating economically and/or efficiently.</p><p>It should be noted that Financial Reporting Accounts (FRAs) were developed as separate accounts in the Chart of Accounts 
to code transactions for accrual accounting purposes.</p><h4>1.4.2 Accounting for Appropriations and other Authorities</h4><p>An appropriation is an authority of Parliament to pay money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF).</p><p>Therefore, an appropriation is required before moneys can be spent by the government. Some authorities are given in the 
form of annually approved limits through appropriation acts. Other authorities come from other legislation in the form of 
statutory spending authority for specific purposes (for example, employee benefits).</p><p>Appropriation authority is the means by which Parliament controls the outflows of money from the CRF. However, there 
are a number of transactions which are charged to a current year appropriation but which do not affect the CRF until a later 
date or not at all, such as:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>certain goods received or services rendered prior to or on <strong>March 31</strong> of a fiscal year, but not paid 
  for until after that date;</li><li>charges made by one government department on another; and</li><li>write-off, forgiveness, etc. of loans, investments or advances.</li></ol><p>As a general rule, transactions are recorded against an appropriation on an "expenditure basis". However, there are certain 
expenditures which are not charged to an appropriation until a payment is required e.g. various allowance or provision accounts 
currently set up by Treasury Board Secretariat such as employee benefit costs for accrued vacation pay, severance pay, etc.</p><p>Currently, accounting for the use of appropriations provides parliamentarians with control over most expenditures of 
the Government, for both amount and purpose. However, it does not give a complete financial picture of the government since 
it lacks information on assets and some liabilities and skews information on program costs. For example, if a department 
purchases a building, the department will record the full expenditure against a particular appropriation in the year acquired 
notwithstanding that the building will provide benefits over a number of years.</p><h4>1.4.3 Reporting by Objects</h4><p>To measure the impact of government transactions on the economy, expenditures are classified according to the type of 
resources (goods and services) acquired, revenue earned or the transfer payments made. Identification of detailed economic 
objects, combined with information from other sectors of the economy, makes possible economic analysis, on a national basis, 
of the effects of government spending. The economic objects are the base code for the object classification and are required 
for government-wide statistical purposes. They may be used by departments as departmental line objects, but departments 
may need more detail for their own purposes.</p><p>To accommodate the need for differing degrees of detail, several levels of classification by object are used. In descending 
order of aggregation, they are: categories, sub-categories; reporting objects; economic, source and class objects; and departmental 
(line) objects. Standard objects, which are the highest level for Parliamentary reporting, can be related to specific categories 
or sub-categories.</p></section><section anchor="1.5" title="1.5 Identifying Important Differences"><p>In order to understand the primary differences between accrual accounting and accounting for the use of appropriations, 
terminology becomes increasingly important. It is necessary to distinguish between certain terms, to ensure that all users 
are consistent when describing a transaction, preparing a journal entry or providing rationale for various accounting treatments.</p><h4>1.5.1 Expenditures versus Expenses versus Disbursements</h4><p>As per the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Public Sector Accounting Handbook (PS) 1500.88, <strong>expenditures</strong> 
are the cost of goods and services acquired in the accounting period whether or not payment has been made or invoices received 
and include transfer payments due where no value is received directly in return.</p><p>Examples would include the payment of grants, contributions, the acquisition or construction of capital assets, and the 
acquisition of operating supplies etc.</p><p><strong>Expenses</strong>, as per PS1500.93 are the cost of resources consumed in and identifiable with the operations 
of the accounting period.</p><p>Expenses include the costs associated with:</p><ul><li>the purchase of goods and services;</li><li>government transfers;</li><li>grants, contributions and donations (non-repayable); and</li><li>consumption of an asset e.g. amortization of a capital asset, consumption of inventory or prepaid expenses.</li></ul><p>Expenses do not include:</p><ul><li>the acquisition or construction of a capital asset;</li><li>the repayment of debt; and</li><li>investments in other entities (both loans and capital injections)</li></ul><p>To further clarify the difference, an expenditure refers to the <strong>acquisition</strong> of a good or service whereas 
an expense refers to the <strong>use</strong> of the good or service acquired. For example, the acquisition cost of a tangible 
capital asset would be an expenditure and the amortization of the cost of that asset would be an expense in the Statement 
of Operations for the period. Conceptually, the cost of an asset is deferred and recognized as an amortization expense over 
the period when the assets are used in delivering government programs.</p><p>A <strong>disbursement</strong> is an outlay of cash. Such disbursements may be in the form of cheques, warrants or through 
the electronic transfer of funds.</p><h4>1.5.2 Revenues versus Receipts</h4><p><strong>Revenues,</strong> from an accrual accounting perspective, are defined as increases in economic resources, either 
by way of inflows of or enhancements to assets or reductions of liabilities, resulting from the ordinary activities of a 
department. As per PS 1500.83-84, revenues should be accounted for in the period in which the transactions or events occurred 
that gave rise to the revenues. For example, user fees should be recorded in the period the goods or services are provided, 
sales and excise taxes should be recorded in the period when the sales are made, and transfer payments for shared cost agreements 
should be recorded in the period the costs are incurred. Items not practicably measured until cash is received would be 
accounted for at that time. Accounting for all of government's revenues ensures that related financial assets are accounted 
for in the period they are created.</p><p>Revenues include amounts earned from:</p><ul><li>taxes;</li><li>the provision of goods and services; and</li><li>interest.</li></ul><p>Revenues do not include</p><ul><li>receivables inflows e.g. payments received for accounts receivables or loans;</li><li>refunds of expenditures; and</li><li>custodial receipts e.g. deposit and trust accounts, etc.</li></ul><p>Revenue earned which is not yet collected in the year would be an accounts receivable.</p><p><strong>Receipts</strong> refer to moneys received, whether through cash, cheque or by electronic transfer of funds.</p></section><section anchor="1.6" title="1.6 Guidance on Accrual Accounting"><p>The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of accrual accounting in the government environment.</p><p><strong>Accounting standards</strong></p><p>"Departments" will follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as defined in the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants Public Sector Accounting (PS) Handbook. Specifically, departments will use the "expense basis" of accounting 
as referred to in the handbook (PS1500.93). Subject to modifications or interpretations by the Treasury Board Accounting 
Standards (TBAS), the PS Handbook will be the authoritative reference manual. In situations where a specific item is not 
covered in the PS Handbook, then the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Handbook will be used.</p><p>This FIS Accounting Manual refers to accounting standards where they are relevant. These are part of GAAP. Where appropriate, 
the text contains a brief description of the requirements of the standards, together with details of any additional or alternative 
accounting treatments. The relevant accounting standards should be consulted for a full understanding of their requirements.</p></section><section anchor="1.7" title="1.7 Other guidance"><p>As mentioned in section 1.2, not every possible Scenario is covered in this Manual. Furthermore, the PS and CICA Handbooks 
may not be explicit enough in certain circumstances. Therefore, it may be necessary to consult alternative sources to determine 
the most appropriate treatment for a particular transaction. An intermediate or advanced accounting textbook would be a 
most valuable source of information, since a variety of Scenario s would be described in sufficient detail to aid departments. 
As well, the Canadian Institute of Public Real Estate Companies (CIPREC) Handbook can serve as a useful guide to help departments 
with real property issues.</p><p>In addition, there will be specific guidance, which will be the responsibility of, and be developed by, departments themselves. 
This means that each department should have an accounting guideline that is sufficiently detailed to deal with its own unique 
circumstances.</p></section><section anchor="1.8" title="1.8 Departmental Reporting"><p>Each department, as defined by Section 2 of the FAA, will produce annually a full set of financial statements as at March 
31 that can withstand the test of audit. These statements will consist of a Statement of Financial Position, a Statement 
of Operations, and a Statement of Cash Requirements, together with required Notes and Schedules.</p><p>The financial statements, accompanied by a Statement of Management Responsibility and Auditor's Report, (if required 
by legislation or policy), must be available to the Receiver General for Canada by June 15<sup>th</sup> of each year. Departments 
will publish these financial statements in their Departmental Performance Report.</p><p>To the extent possible, department specific financial information now contained in the Public Accounts will be included 
in either the departmental financial statements or the supplementary financial information attached thereto. All financial 
information required on a government-wide basis would continue to be included in the Public Accounts.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2.0 Accounting Principles"><p>To prepare financial statements, there are certain basic accounting principals that need to be generally recognized and 
understood before individual transactions can be analyzed.</p><section anchor="2.1" title="2.1 Going Concern"><p>The going concern principle is applied on the expectation that a department will continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future and there is no intention to curtail its operation.</p><p>The implications of this going concern principle are critical. The historical cost principle (described below) would 
be of limited usefulness if it were not for the going concern principle. For example, amortization policies are only justifiable 
and appropriate if we assume continuity of the department.</p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="2.2 Historical Cost"><p>The determination of the measurement base on which an item is to be recognized in financial statements has been one of 
the most difficult problems in accounting. A number of bases exist on which an amount for a single item can be measured 
e.g. replacement cost, net realizable value (net amount that would be received from selling an asset), present value of 
future cash flows, market value, original cost (less amortization, where appropriate) etc.</p><p>Generally, under existing GAAP, transactions and events are recognized in financial statements at the amount of cash 
or cash equivalents paid or received or the fair value ascribed to them when they took place; i.e., historical cost. By 
using historical cost as the basis for record-keeping, financial statements will contain objective and verifiable information. 
Historical cost provides financial statement users with a stable and consistent benchmark that they can rely on to establish 
historical trends.</p><p>This concept is especially critical since there is a great deal of controversy about valuation of real property and other 
tangible assets carried by departments for many years. The historical cost is not always available or relevant to the users 
of the financial statements and must be supplemented by other financial information relevant to the decision making.</p></section><section anchor="2.3" title="2.3 Matching Principle"><p>The matching principle requires that revenue and expenses be accrued; that is, they are recognized as they are earned 
or incurred, not just when they are received or paid or when they affect an appropriation.</p><p>Under the matching principle, inclusion or exclusion of an item of revenue or expenses will depend on the period to which 
it relates, the period in which it was received or performed, or the period in which it was consumed, used or lost, subject 
in all cases to materiality considerations.</p><p>In general accounting literature, the matching principle normally refers to the matching of revenue and expenses. However, 
with minor exceptions, departments do not generate major amounts of non-tax revenue but are funded through appropriations. 
As such, the matching principle must take on a slightly different interpretation. Consequently, revenues should be recognized 
when the goods and/or services have been rendered and expenses should be matched to program delivery outputs of services 
to the public.</p><p>For example, in the case of tangible capital assets, a systematic and rational allocation policy is used to approximate 
the matching principle. This type of expense recognition involves making assumptions about the benefits that are being received 
as well as the cost associated with those benefits. The cost of a long-lived asset is allocated over the accounting periods 
during which the asset is used because it is assumed that the asset contributes to the generation of program outputs throughout 
its useful life.</p></section><section anchor="2.4" title="2.4 Consistency"><p>There should be consistency of accounting treatment of like items within each accounting period and from one period to 
the next. This is particularly important if users are to compare successive years' accounts, for example, to identify trends 
in revenue and expenses. Changes in accounting policies and practices should generally only be made when those changes will 
result in fairer presentations of financial results. Any changes that have a significant impact on departmental and or consolidated 
results should only be made after prior discussion with TBS.</p><p>Consistency does not mean that different organizations must apply the same accounting methods. This may be thought to 
improve comparability between departments. However, requiring such uniformity may result in dissimilar circumstances between 
departments being reported as being similar. For example, amortization policies should be developed on the basis of what 
best reflects the consumption of the asset in its particular operating environment. There may be different operating environments 
in each department.</p></section><section anchor="2.5" title="2.5 Materiality"><p>Materiality is a term used to describe the significance of financial statement information to users. It is a matter of 
judgement in the particular circumstances. An item, or an aggregate of items, is material if it is probable that its omission 
or misstatement would influence or change a decision. In short, it must make a difference or it need not be disclosed. It 
is difficult to provide firm guidelines to help judge when an item is or is not material because materiality depends on 
the relative size of the item compared to the size of other items and the nature of the item itself.</p><p>In determining whether an item or an aggregation of items is material, the following factors should be considered:</p><ul><li>the size of the item;</li><li>nature of the item - for example, irregularities or illegal acts by departmental personnel would be material even 
  if the amounts were small; and,</li><li>cumulative effects - the total effect of individual amounts on the financial statements taken as a whole.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that specific disclosures in annual financial statements required by legislation must be complied 
with regardless of the amounts involved.</p><p>Care should be taken in reporting immaterial items since reporting them could otherwise impair the clarity and understandability 
of the financial statements and notes.</p></section><section anchor="2.6" title="2.6 Substance over Form"><p>Financial statements should present the economic substance of transactions and events even though their legal form may 
suggest a different treatment. As such, departments must ensure that transactions and events affecting their entity are 
presented in the financial statements in a manner that is in agreement with the actual underlying transactions and events. 
Thus, transactions and events are accounted for and presented in a manner that conveys their substance rather than necessarily 
their legal or other form. For example, a) capital leases should be accounted for by the lessee as an acquisition of an 
asset and an assumption of an obligation, since the lease transfers substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership 
related to the leased property from the lessor to the lessee. b) repayable contributions may appear to be an expense for 
the period but some of them are in fact loans. Therefore those, which meet the definition of a loan according to the PS 
Handbook, should be accounted for as a loan receivable. Depending on the terms of the agreement, some of them may need to 
be treated as concessionary loans.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3.0 Assets"><p>Assets are economic resources controlled by a government as a result of past transactions or events and from which future 
economic benefits may be obtained.</p><p>Assets have three essential characteristics:</p><ul><li>they embody a future benefit that involves a capacity, singly, or in combination with other assets to provide future 
  net cash flows, or to provide goods and services;</li><li>the government can control access to the benefit; and</li><li>the transaction or event giving rise to the government's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred. 
  PS 3150.04</li></ul><p>Assets appear on a Department's Statement of Financial Position, and they are divided into either of two categories, 
Financial Assets and Non-Financial Assets.</p><p><strong>Financial Assets</strong></p><p>Financial assets are those assets on hand at the end of an accounting period, which are expected to be turned into cash. 
They are not intended for consumption in the normal course of operations. Examples of these assets include cash, accounts 
receivables, loans and advances, inventories held for resale, etc.</p><p><strong>Non-Financial Assets</strong></p><p>Non-financial Assets are assets that have economic lives that may extend beyond the accounting period and are intended 
for consumption in the normal course of operations. They generally are converted into expenses in future periods. Examples 
of these assets include capital assets, inventories of supplies, and prepayments, including transfer prepayments.</p><section anchor="3.1" title="3.1 Cash"><h4>Introduction</h4><p>From a departmental perspective, "cash" includes cash on hand, cash in transit, and cash on deposit.</p><p>It should be noted that the main focus of the "cash" component would be that of a typical department's day-to-day handling

specific amount, at a specified time or times, or on demand, usually with interest but not necessarily.</p><p>The terms of a loan agreement describe when a loan is due. The terms may specify a calendar date or dates for repayment, 
or may describe the particular time(s) or circumstance(s) which will determine repayment. For example, repayment may be 
contingent on future events, such as commodity prices or operating results. (PS 3050.07)</p><p><strong>Recognition</strong></p><p>A loan receivable should be recognized on a government's statement of financial position when:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>the government assumes the risks associated with, and acquires the right to receive, payment of principal and any 
  related payments of interest; and</li><li>the amount of the loan can be reliably measured.</li></ol><p>This normally coincides with the disbursement of funds, exchange of other assets, or assumption of liabilities. (PS 3050.26)</p><p>A loan receivable should be removed from a government's statement of financial position when it has been repaid, the 
risks and rewards associated with the loan have been transferred, the right to repayment has expired or been waived, or 
it is written off. (PS 3050.28)</p><p><em>For the purposes of Write-offs and Allowances, there are two types of loans receivables:</em></p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Those that are charged to a non- budgetary appropriation (G and H appropriation)</li><li>Those that are charged to a budgetary appropriation (B appropriation) e.g. unconditional repayable contributions</li></ol><p><strong>Write-offs</strong></p><p>For accrual accounting purposes, when the amount of a loss is known with sufficient precision, and there is no realistic 
prospect of recovery, the loan receivable should be reduced by the amount of that loss. (PS 3050.38)</p><p>For authority accounting purposes, loans receivables that were charged to a non-budgetary appropriation would require 
a charge to a budgetary appropriation when the loan is to written off (see Scenario B). Whereas, loans receivables that 
were originally charged to a budgetary appropriation are not charged to an appropriation at the time of write-off.</p><p><strong>Allowances</strong></p><p>It should be noted that Departments <strong>will not set-up an allowance</strong> for uncollectible loans receivables 
(for those <strong>loans charged to a non-budgetary appropriation</strong>). This will be done centrally by Treasury Board 
Secretariat. However, as requested, Departments will provide TBS all the necessary information required to determine the 
provision even though they will not record the transaction in their books.</p><p>In the case of <strong>loans receivables charged to budgetary appropriation</strong>, departments will be responsible 
for <strong>setting up an allowance</strong> for those loans they deem to be uncollectible.</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a></li><li>TBAS 3.2 Transfers (Grants and Contributions)</li><li>PS 3050</li><li>Debt Deletion section of the Manual</li><li>Debt Write-off Regulations, 1994 (pursuant to section 25(1) for the FAA)</li><li>FAA act , sections 23, 24 and 25</li></ul><h4>Scenario A</h4><p>Department makes a loan of $500,000 to an organization to finance the construction of exhibition buildings.

as revenue for the period. In this case, interest revenue and interest receivable is recorded monthly. However, depending

the first month is as follows: $2,500 =$500,000 x (6%/12months).</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> There is no impact on authorities with respect to interest receivable, therefore 
R300 would be used. Interest revenue from loans will be recorded in E500.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale</strong>: "4804 - Interest on loans and advances from other domestic private sector enterprises"

This is reflected by a debit to the Cash in Hands of Departments awaiting deposit to RG. The outstanding amount of the loan 
receivable is also reduced. When the interest is paid, the accrued interest receivable is reversed. The amount of loan repayment 
is: $9,666.40 = $7,166.40 (principal portion) + $2,500 (interest portion). These amounts are derived using a loan calculation 
program.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> H/G*, the repayment of the loan should be credited back against the appropriation 
it was originally charged in order for departments to complete the Source and Disposition of Authorities in Volume II Part 
I of the Public Accounts. Crediting the repayment back to the original loan appropriations does not give departments the 
authority to respend that amount for further loans. Any authority to issue further loans from the repayments would have 
to be determined from the specific loan authority granted to the department by the government. If there is no impact on 
authorities as the loan gets repaid, R300 can be used for both the loans receivable and the accrued interest receivable. 
Since there is no impact on the authority side for cash, R300 is used.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale</strong>: The Department records the cash as being received by the RG resulting in the offset 
debit entry being reflected in the Cash Deposit Control Account. As the loan is repaid "5015 - Settlement of loans with 
cash" is used. To indicate the net impact on the accrued interest receivable "5399 - Net Change to Accounts Receivable is 
used. To record the net impact on cash accounts "5299 - Net Increase or Decrease in Cash Accounts" should be used.</p><h4>Scenario B - Write-off of a loan receivable</h4><p>The Department has determined that $50,000 of the loan issued will not be collectible, and will therefore have to be 
written off. The department has obtained the appropriate approval to write-off the loan.</p><h4>Journal Entries</h4><p>1) Loan write-off</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR Bad debt expense</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>50,000</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>51732</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>B161</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>3215/3217</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Loans Receivable</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>50,000</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>13219</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>F319</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5021</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>FRA coding rationale:</strong> A loan receivable should be written off as soon as it is known to be uncollectible. 
The balance is removed from the books by debiting Bad Debt Expense and crediting Loans Receivable. A charge is made directly 
to Bad Debt Expense since the department does not set up an allowance for doubtful loans with respect to those loans</p><p><strong>Authority code rationale:</strong> Since the loan receivable was originally charged to a non-budgetary appropriation, 
a write-off would require a charge to a budgetary appropriation. In order to write-off the loan receivable, a charge to 
"B161-Debt write-offs" would be made. However, this code would only apply to non-statutory loans that are given out. B162 
would be used if the debt was forgiven. As well, Parliamentary approval would be required to write-off the debt. With respect 
to write-offs the credit side of the transaction is coded with an "F" code. For further information, please refer to 3.2.4 
on Debt Deletions.</p><p><strong>Object rationale:</strong> The economic object to use is "3215- Deletion and write-off of loans, investments 
and advances" if the loan is written-off or "3217- Forgiveness of loans, investments and advances" if it is forgiven. The 
write-off of a loan would require that "5021- Write-off of loans" be used.</p><h4>Departmental Financial Statement Presentation and Disclosure Requirements</h4><p>Loans receivable should be disclosed under the heading Financial Assets in the Department's Statement of Financial Position.</p><p>In describing the accounting policies selected by a government and applied to its loans receivable, Departments should

for in accordance with PS 3050.20.</p><ul><li>"Significant" for this purpose is defined to be when the grant portion is greater than 25% of the contribution. The 
  grant portion would be recognized as a transfer expense. (Please note: If this condition is not met, then the loan would

of the grant portion. The face value ($192,000) is made up of two parts, the principal and the interest foregone. The interest 
is equal to the unamortized discount, which also represents the grant portion of the contribution in this Scenario. The 
unamortized discount of $48,279.90 is calculated by discounting the loan payment of $192,000 using the Consolidated Revenue 
Fund Lending Rate, assumed to be 6%. Since $48,279.90 is greater than 25% of the repayable contribution of $192,000 (i.e. 
$48,000), the grant portion must be recorded as a transfer payment expense.</p><p>$192,000 represents the future value of the loan since this is the total amount the recipient must repay ($4,000 x 48 
payments). Therefore, this amount must be discounted to determine the net present value of the loan. Due to the structure 
of the loan payments, the discounting is somewhat complicated.</p><ul><li>The first step is to discount the 48 monthly repayments of $4,000 back to the point where loan payments begin (June 
  1, 2004).</li><li>The second step is to discount the value calculated in the first step to the point in time when the money was loaned 
  out to the recipient (June 1, 2001).</li><li>The third step is to take the difference in face value of the loan and the discounted amount of the loan to come up 
  with the unamortized discount.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p><p>It is assumed that the loan repayments of $4,000 are made at the beginning of each month. Therefore, a factor that represents 
the present value of an annuity due would be used, (PVIFA Due). The factor used in this part of the calculation would be 
42.7932 (PVIFA Due for 48 periods at.005%).</p><ul><li>.005% = 6% divided by 12 months. Since payments are made monthly, it is necessary to use a monthly rate of interest.</li><li>The following amount would result: $171,172.80 = $4,000/month X 42.7932 (PVIFA Due, 48 periods,.005%)</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>It is necess ary to discount the sum of the discounted payments ($171,172.80) back to when the loan was issued on 
  June 01, 2001. A factor that represents the present value of a single sum (PVIF) is used: PVIF, 3 periods at 6% =.83962.</li></ol><p>The following amount would result:</p><p><strong>$143,720.10</strong> = $171,172.80 x.83962 (PVIF 3 periods at 6%)</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p><p>The amount of the unamortized discount would be the difference between the face value of the loan and the discounted 
value of the loan.</p><p>The following amount would result:</p><p><strong>$48,279.90</strong> = $192,000.00-$143,720.10</p><p>The unamortized Discount on Transfers represents the grant portion and is a contra asset to the Loans Receivable - URC 
account. These two items are netted to produce the requisite balance required for the statement of financial position. The 
interest free portion of the loan is concessionary and is more in the nature of a grant, therefore that portion should be 
recognized as an expense. As a result, the $48,279.90 is debited to Transfer Payment Expense. Since the face value of the 
loan is what the Department is lending to the company, $192,000 is recorded as a payable.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> In this example an URC payment is charged to a budgetary vote that being 
B15A(*) - Grant and Contribution vote but depending on the department's vote structure, B11A - Program Vote could be used 
as well. Since accounts payable has no impact on appropriations, R300 is used. The concept of the concessionary terms resulting 
in a grant portion is strictly an accrual concept. This does not impact authorities, therefore F codes are used for both 
the Transfer Payment Expense and Unamortized Discount on Transfers.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale</strong>: "6299 - Net Increase or Decrease to Other Liability accounts" should be used to indicate 
the establishment of the accounts payable. "2151 - Recoverable subsidy payments to industry" is used at this point to indicate 
the disbursement of the transfer payment. The concept of the concessionary terms resulting in a grant portion is strictly 
an accrual concept. This does not impact authorities, therefore the same object code is used for the expense and the unamortized 
discount, "3453 - Recognition of unamortized expenses related an asset".</p><p>2) To record the amortization of discount as at year-end March 31, 2002</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR Unamortized Discount on RC</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5,747.60</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>13388</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>F322</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>7099</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Amortization of Discount on RC</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5,747.60</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>42161</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>F251</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>7099</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>FRA Coding Rationale:</strong> In accordance with PS 3050.24, the amount of the loan discount should be amortized 
to revenue in a rational and systematic manner over the term of the loan. For administrative ease, it is suggested that 
the unamortized discount be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan. The amount in the contra asset 
account (Unamortized Discount on RC) is reallocated to the "Amortization of Discounts on Repayable Contributions" account, 
which serves as the revenue account. The loan covers a period of seven years or 84 months (36 months with no payments plus 
48 months of payments). The unamortized discount on the repayable contribution would be amortized over the period of the 
loan. The monthly rate would be $574.76 ($48,279.90 / 84 months). At 31 March 2002, an amount of $5,747.60 (10 months x 
$574.76) would be amortized.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> This is strictly an accrual entry. There is no impact on authorities, therefore

authority, E500, as these amounts are credited as revenues for authority purposes. Since there is no impact on the authority 
side for cash, R300 is used.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> As the loan is paid back the objects need to reflect the repayment, "2151 - Recoverable 
subsidy payments to industry" is used, as this is a repayment of an amount. To record the net impact on cash accounts "5299

The percentage of loans receivables may be applied using one composite rate that reflects an estimate of the uncollectible 
loan receivables.

at the same time. The allowance for doubtful loans is a valuation account (i.e. contra asset) and is subtracted from the 
gross amount of the Loans receivable on the "Statement of Financial Position".</p><p><strong>Authority code rationale:</strong> Since the establishment of an allowance for doubtful loans does not impact 
appropriations, F codes are used. "F122 - Allowances set up for bad debt expenses" is used for the Bad debt expense and 
"F412 - Changes to allowances for doubtful accounts" is used for Allowance for doubtful loans.</p><p><strong>Object rationale:</strong> There is no impact on objects when the allowance for doubtful accounts is set up. 
Bad debt expense is a non-cash expense, therefore it falls under standard object 12 and sub-category 34. The economic object 
used for bad expense is 3462. For non-cash items related to assets and liabilities, sub-category 70 is used. 7021 is used 
for Allowance for Valuation of financial claims.</p><h4>Scenario C - Write-off of a URC</h4><p>The Department has a URC with concessionary terms on their books with a value of $20,000 and unamortized discount of

The balance 
is removed from the books by debiting Allowance for Doubtful Loans, crediting Loans Receivable - URC and debiting any remaining 
Unamortized Discount on Transfers.</p><p><strong>Authority code rationale:</strong> There is no effect on appropriations. Since the URC contribution was originally 
charged to a budgetary vote (grant and contribution or program vote), there is no requirement to get it off the books via 
a budgetary appropriation since it has already been charged to the budgetary appropriation. Consequently, there is no effect 
on appropriations. Therefore, R300 is used for loans receivable-URC, "F322 - Unamortized Discount on repayable contributions" 
is used for the unamortized discount on Transfers" and F412 - Changes to allowances for doubtful accounts" is used for Allowance 
for doubtful loans. Notwithstanding that an appropriation is not effected, Treasury Board approval may still be required. 
See section 25 of the FAA and sections 4 and 5 of the Debt Write-off Regulations.</p><p><strong>Object rationale:</strong> "5021 - Write-off of loans" is used to indicate write-off of a loan receivable. For 
non-cash items related to assets and liabilities, sub-category 70 is used. 7021 is used for Allowance for valuation of Financial 
claims and 7099 is used for Unamortized Discount on Transfers.</p><h4>Departmental Financial Statement Presentation and Disclosure Requirements</h4><p>Loans receivable should be disclosed net of unamortized discount and allowance for bad loans under the heading Financial

from the Standing Advance is reflected as an operating expense. The reimbursement to the holder replenishes the Standing 
advance to its original amount. Since the employee paid GST on his purchases, this amount should be recorded to the GST 
refundable advance account. Any PST paid is included with operating expenses.</p><p><strong>Authority Rationale:</strong> The expenses, claimed by the Standing Advance holder, are a legitimate charge against 
a departmental appropriation. Depending on the vote structure of the particular department, B11A or B12A is appropriate. 
There could be other Authority Codes used for different Scenario s e.g. if the expenses were to be recorded against a Specified 
Purpose Account (SPA). Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it is set up as an advance under 
a special authority G111.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> The objects to be used depend on the nature of the expenses incurred when the standing 
advance was reimbursed to its original amount. Departments should code the total of all individual transactions under $100 
in the same manner as the policy for purchases procured by acquisition cards. "6299 - Net Increase or Decrease to Other 
Liability Accounts" is used to establish or increase an accounts payable. Since there is GST/HST on the purchases, the GST

The accountable advance 
is no longer outstanding, so it is reversed. Since the department owes the individual the balance of $107.10, the amount 
must be accrued and recorded as a payable. Since the employee paid GST on his purchases, this amount should be record the 
GST refundable advance account. Any PST paid would be included as part of the operating expenses.</p><p><strong>Authority Rationale:</strong> In this case, the operating expenses are greater than the accountable advance given 
to the individual. This difference must be charged to the appropriate vote or other authority code e.g. SPAs. This can be 
achieved by netting operating expenses and accountable advances, and coding both with the same vote either B11A or B12A 
(depending on the department's vote structure). If the expense is to be charged to another authority code e.g. SPA, then 
the appropriation must be credited for the full advance and the full expense charged to the other authority. Since GST is 
not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it is set up as an advance under a special authority G111.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> "0201-Travel -public servants " is used since operating expenses in this Scenario

there is GST on the purchases, the GST must be reflected by using "8171 - Payment of GST on purchases".</p><p>2b) Expenses amount to $937.89 (including $61.36 of GST). The employee submits his claim for settlement along with a

there is a requirement to reduce the net charge to the appropriations. To achieve this effect on authorities both the debit

Crown to collect the debts. The purpose of write-offs is to reduce the costs of maintaining records of accounts receivable 
that are valueless or uncollectible. Forgiveness and remission is a process that extinguishes a debt, releases the debtor 
from all liability, waives the Crown's right to reinstate the debt, and permits both the Crown and the debtor to remove 
the debt form their accounts. The major difference between the two is that forgiveness is used for non-budgetary transactions 
such as loans whereas remission is applied to budgetary expenditures only.</p><p>No write-off or forgiveness of a debt can occur without an appropriate authority.</p><ul><li>If a debt results from a <strong>budgetary expenditure</strong> (i.e. accounts receivable, repayable contribution) 
  then the debt can be written off under <strong>departmental authority</strong>.</li><li>If a debt results from a <strong>non-budgetary expenditure</strong> (i.e. loan receivable) then the write-off and 
  forgiveness of the debt requires a <strong>charge to a budgetary vote</strong> and <strong>parliamentary authority.</strong></li></ul><p>There are two Scenario s with respect to debt deletions, those that do not require a charge to an appropriation and those 
that do.</p><p><strong>No charge to a Budgetary Vote Required for Write-Off of Debt</strong></p><div class="indent1"><p>1a) A trade accounts receivable is the result of the provision of goods/services. Since the expenditures related to the 
products that were sold were originally charged to a budgetary vote (operating, program, capital vote etc), there is no 
requirement to get it off the books via a budgetary vote.</p><p>1b) Repayable contributions are charged via a budgetary vote (Grant and Contributions appropriation)when payment is made 
to the recipient. To write it off, section 25.1 of the FAA would apply. A charge to an appropriation is not required thus 
an F code would be used, but ministerial approval would be required.</p></div><p>Anything charged to a budgetary vote can be written off under ministerial authority except those debts identified in 
Section 5 of the Debt Write-off regulations. In these cases approval of TB is required but no charge to budgetary vote is 
required.</p><p><strong>Charge to a Budgetary Vote Required for Write-Off of Debt</strong></p><div class="indent1"><p>2a) If the receivable to be deleted is recorded on the Statement of Financial Position through a Loan Vote (originally 
charged to a non-budgetary L vote i.e. a loan or an accountable advance), then departments must charge the write-off to 
a budgetary vote.</p></div><p>For those departments that issue advances through there own Working Capital Advance Appropriations such as DND and DFAIT, 
the accountable advance would have arisen as a result of the original transaction having been charged to a non-budgetary 
vote. For example an individual submits a travel claim for an amount, which is less than the amount advanced, which was 
charged to an accountable advance account (an asset account). If the amount was not collected on the settlement of the claim 
there is amount owing by the claimant which should be set up in departmental books as an accounts receivable. In order to 
write this amount off, the approval of TBS would be required as well as a charge to an appropriation. This is because the 
payment for which recovery is being suspended has never been charged a budgetary vote. It should be noted that since this 
Scenario is only relevant to a few departments this will not be explored in any further detail.</p><p>Generally speaking:</p><p><strong>Non-Budgetary votes</strong> are those for expenditures that are to be recorded on the Statement of Assets/Liabilities 
of the Government of Canada as some kind of asset and are identified by the letter L in the Estimates. Examples include 
loans, accountable advances and investments in Crown Corporations.</p><p><strong>Budgetary Votes</strong> are those for expenditures which are charged to either a program vote, operating vote, 
capital vote or grants &amp; contribution (G&amp;C) vote.</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li>Debt Write-off Regulations, 1994 (pursuant to section 25(1) for the FAA)</li><li>FAA act, sections 23, 24 and 25</li></ul><h4>Scenario A - Write off of an Accounts Receivable</h4><p>See the Accounts Receivable section of the manual.</p><h4>Scenario B - Write-off of a Conditional Repayable Contribution</h4><p>Same as a write-off for an Account Receivable.

indirectly in the delivery of program outputs. They include all items such as equipment, spare parts and material that are 
held in stores and warehouses for issue at a later date to be used in future program delivery. They also include inventories 
held for resale within the Government of Canada. Consumable inventories exclude purchases that meet the capitalization criteria 
specified in TBAS 3.1 Capital Assets.</p><p>2<em>- Inventories held for resale</em> are physical items that will be sold (or used to produce a product which will 
be sold, e.g. raw materials) in the future in the ordinary course of business to parties outside of the Government reporting 
entity.</p><p>The majority of departments will have consumable inventories. There may be some revolving funds and a handful of departments 
that have inventories for resale.</p><h4>Determining Inventory Quantities</h4><p>The physical quantities in inventory may be determined by means of a periodic inventory system or a perpetual inventory 
system.</p><p><strong>(a) Periodic Inventory System</strong></p><p>An actual physical count of goods on hand is taken at the end of each period for which financial statements are to be 
prepared. The goods are counted, weighed or measured, then extended at <em>unit costs</em> to derive the inventory valuation. 
When a periodic inventory system is used, end-of-the period entries are required for (a) transferring opening inventory 
to expense and (b) recording the ending inventory.</p><p>For inventories held for resale, where the inventory records are maintained on a periodic inventory system, typically 
a purchases accounting is used to record acquisition. The balance in the inventory account (which represents the beginning 
inventory) is unchanged during the period. At the end of the accounting period a closing entry is made that debits the Inventory 
account for the ending inventory amount and credits the Inventory account for the beginning inventory amount. Cost of goods 
sold is determined by using the following calculation: Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases - Ending Inventory.</p><p>For consumable inventories, acquisitions of inventory throughout the year may be charged to an expense account. At the 
end of the year, the ending inventory would be recorded with an equivalent reduction in expenses.</p><p>It would not be practical for departments with sizeable inventories to do a physical count every year for the purpose 
of determining ending inventory. Where amounts are significant, central agencies need to know the expenses associated with 
inventory usage more frequently than annually. It is strongly recommended that departments maintain their records on a perpetual 
inventory system (see below)</p><p><strong>(b) Perpetual Inventory System</strong></p><p>It is particularly useful (a) to control and safeguard inventory and (b) to facilitate preparation of monthly statements. 
Furthermore, it is considered to be one of the essential characteristics of a good cost accounting system.</p><p>Purchases are debited directly to the inventory control account and concurrently entered into the detailed inventory 
records. As items of inventory are issued, the transaction is recorded in the accounts so that it carries a perpetual or 
continuing balance of the goods that should be on hand at each date.</p><p>Physical counts are usually made at least annually or on a continuous rotation basis (using sampling) when large inventories 
are involved to verify if there is any loss or error in the record keeping.</p><h4>Discrepancies in Inventory Count</h4><p>Regardless of the inventory control and records in place, loss and errors are always present. When a difference exists 
between the count and the perpetual inventory account balance, an entry is needed for reconciliation.</p><p>Note that in the periodic inventory system, the Inventory Over and Short account does not exist because there are no 
accounting records available against which to compare the physical count. Consequently, overages and shortages are buried 
in cost of goods sold (for inventories held for resale) or operating expenses (for consumable inventories).</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li>TBAS 3.4 Inventories</li><li>CICA Handbook Sections 1520.04, 3030.05-.06, 3030.09-.10</li><li>PS 1500-47, 1500.49</li></ul><h4>Scenario A - Purchasing and Issuing Inventory Under a Perpetual Inventory System</h4><p>Department purchases spare parts for vehicles for $50,000.

Delivery cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the inventories. At this point the Department is being charged 
GST on the purchase of inventories, and must pay it. However, the Department will eventually recover this amount from Canada 
Customer and Revenue Agency (CCRA) and should record it as "13392 GST/HST Refundable advance accounts". The cost of the 
consumable inventories plus 7% GST would be set up as an accounts payable in the period since costs were incurred but not 
yet paid. Note: if the inventory had been held for resale, FRA "15120 - Inventories held for resale" would be used instead 
of 15110.</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> B11/B12* Since this is a legitimate charge against an operating appropriation, 
it would be recorded against either B11A or B12A depending on whether the department has a program vote (B11A) or an operating 
vote (B12A). Please note that if the entity is a revolving fund the charge to the appropriation would be to A5XX. Since 
GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it is set up as an advance under a special authority, G111. There 
is no impact on authorities for the accounts payable so the code to be used would be "R300-All other assets and liabilities"</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> Object 1267 is used in this example since spare parts were purchased for the 
Department's vehicles. The appropriate object is used depending on the nature of the purchase. "0210 - Transportation of 
things not elsewhere specified" is used to record the freight charges. If a department's system cannot handle the use of

under a contribution agreement may be made where it is essential to the achievement of the program objectives and is specifically

as a prepayment and is recognized as an expense once the eligible costs have been incurred.</p><p><strong>Prepaid Expenses and Deferred Charges</strong></p><p>A prepaid expense or a deferred charge is an allocation to current and/or future periods of past costs where benefits 
will occur in the current and/or future periods. The distinction between the two is the duration of the benefits to be realized; 
prepaid expenses provide future benefits over a shorter period of time than do deferred charges.</p><p>It should be noted that all research and development costs will be expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
Costs related to in-house developed software will be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Board Accounting 
Standard 3.1.1 on Software and not as a component of research and development costs.</p><p><strong>Amortization</strong></p><p>Government departments have many expenses that they incur on a regular basis. Rent, utilities, subscriptions, payments 
in lieu of taxes and many other expenses must be paid monthly, or on some other cyclical basis. When expenses are prepaid, 
an asset is recognized for the amount paid. This is charged to expenses gradually as the prepaid expense is consumed.</p><p>Where appropriate, amortization of any deferred charge or prepaid expense will be charged as an expense on a systematic 
and rational basis related to use.</p><p><strong>Write-offs</strong></p><p>The balance of any prepaid expense or deferred charge shall be written off to expense in the period that no future benefits

on rent (excludes rent paid to PWGSC) or is included as part of rent charges and hence should be recorded to the GST refundable 
advance account.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> It is assumed that the rent expense will be charged to the Operating Vote 
(B12A), but it could also be charged to the Program Vote (B11A) depending on the Department's vote structure. Since Accounts 
Payable does not affect appropriations, R300 is used. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it

Rental of office buildings" is used to record the prepaid rent, because the rent is for an office building. "6299 - Net

account, since it is above the $10,000 threshold. Delivery costs should be capitalized as part of the laid down cost of 
the asset. At this point the Department is being charged GST on the vehicle, and must pay it to the vendor. However, as 
the Department will eventually recover this amount from Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), they should record it 
as an asset in "13392 GST/HST Refundable advance accounts". Since the Department has not paid for the vehicle, a liability 
must be recorded for the amount owing.</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> (*) In this example it is assumed this purchase would be charged to the 
capital vote. However, depending on the department and the asset purchased, the following authority codes could be used: 
B11A - Program Vote, B12A Operating Vote, or A131 Spending of amounts equivalent to proceeds from disposal of surplus Crown 
assets. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it is set up as an advance under a special authority, 
G111. There is no impact on authorities for the accounts payable so the code to be used would be "R300-All other assets 
and liabilities"</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> As economic objects are recorded on an expenditure basis, the economic object 
is recorded at this point. Economic object 1261 is used in this example since the purchase was a motor vehicle. The appropriate 
economic object is used depending on the nature of the purchase. Economic object "0210-Transportation of things not elsewhere 
specified" would be used to record freight. However, where a department's system cannot handle the use of more than one 
economic object for an asset, the cost of freight may be coded to the same object code as the asset. Since there is GST/HST 
payable, the GST must be reflected by using, "8171-Payment of GST on purchases". "6299-Net Increase or Decrease to Other 
Liability Accounts" is used to establish the accrual of the amount owing.</p><p><strong>Alternative set of entries:</strong> Departments may choose to record the purchase as an operating expense and

and systematic manner over those periods expected to benefit from the use of the asset. Using straight-line amortization, 
the monthly charge to amortization expense and accumulated amortization would be $200 ($24,000/10yrs = $2,400/year; $2,400/12mths 
= $200/month).</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> Expenditures for the acquisition were charged to an appropriation in the 
previous journal entry, therefore the appropriations are not affected in this journal entry. To assist with departmental 
reconciliations, F codes are used for these non-appropriated amounts. "F111 - Expenditures previously charged to appropriations/Amortization 
expenses for capital assets" is used for amortization expense and "F311 - Non-appropriated amounts added to or deducted 
from asset balances/ Increases (decreases) to accumulated amortization of capital assets" is used for accumulated amortization.</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> As these are non-cash (non-expenditure) items, they have no effect on economic 
objects." 7061 - Accumulated amortization on capital assets" is used to capture accumulated amortization. Alternatively, 
"7099 - Net increase or decrease in other transactions" may also be used. "3451 - Amortization expense for capital assets" 
is used to capture amortization expense.</p><p>4) To record payment of vehicle on April 15, 2000.</p><p>See section on Accounts Payable for related entries.</p><h4>Scenario B - Betterment</h4><p>A betterment should be capitalized if the amount exceeds the department's threshold for betterments.

threshold for betterments, then the department should expense it.</p><p>The Department owns a building with an original cost of $250,000 and a useful life of 40 years. After 20 years the Department 
decides to do a major renovation that will increase the amount of usable space. The renovation work is contracted to one 
company and has a cost of $75,000. At this point the net book value of the building is $125,000 ($250,000/40yrs = $6,250/yr) 
($6,250/yrx20yrs = 125,000) ($250,000-$125,000 = $125,000)</p><h4>Journal Entries</h4><p>1) Record the betterment</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR Buildings</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>75000</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>16112</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>B14A(*)</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>1340</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR GST Refundable Advance</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5250</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>13392</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>G111</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>8171</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Accounts Payable</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>80,250</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>21111</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>R300</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>6299</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>FRA coding rationale: </strong>Since the renovation is a betterment, it is added to the cost of the building 
i.e. capitalized as part of the building cost. The new value of the building is $200,000 ($125,000+$75,000). The amortization 
expense on the building will now increase to $10,000 ($200,000/20 years).</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> (*) In this example it is assumed this purchase would be charged to the 
capital vote. However, depending on the department and the asset purchased, the following authority codes could be used: 
B11A - Program Vote, B12A Operating Vote, or A131 Spending of amounts equivalent to proceeds from disposal of surplus Crown 
assets. There is no impact on the authority side for the accounts payable but as the system requires that a code be used, 
it would be "R300 - All other assets and liabilities"</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> As economic objects are recorded on an expenditure basis, the economic object 
is recorded at this point, and not when the cash (disbursement) is paid out. Economic object 1340 is used (in this example) 
since the renovation was on a building. If the details of the renovation expenditures are provided on the contractor's invoices 
and the department's system can accommodate the use of more than one economic object per asset class, it would be preferable 
to use the different economic object codes depending on the nature of the purchase (as done in Scenario C). "6299 - Net

wagons and light commercial trucks) and whether departments can trade these assets for similar or different types of assets 
(see the <em>Material Management Policy</em> and <em>Motor Vehicle Policy: </em><a href="/pubs_pol/dcgpubs/materielmanage/siglist_eng.asp">/pubs_pol/dcgpubs/materielmanage/siglist_eng.asp</a>).</p><p>The Department trades in an old piece of research equipment for a new piece of research equipment.

books. Because the Department received $600 for the trade-in, the loss on the disposal of the trade-in is $400 ($8,000-$7,000-$600). 
The equipment (new) is recorded at its original purchase price and the amount payable to the vendor is the difference between 
the purchase price of the equipment (new) and the $600 received for the trade in, plus GST of $658. GST is payable on the 
net purchase price of the equipment (7% of $9,400).</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> (*) In this example it is assumed this purchase (equipment (new)) would 
be charged to the capital vote. However, depending on the department and the asset purchased, the following authority codes 
could be used: B11A - Program Vote, B12A Operating Vote, or A131 Spending of amounts equivalent to proceeds from disposal 
of surplus Crown assets. There is no impact on the authority side for the accounts payable, "R300- All other assets and 
liabilities" would be used. "D321 - Proceeds from disposal of crown assets" is used ($7,000+$400-$8,000) to reflect proceeds 
of $600 received by the Department for the old equipment. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, 
it is set up as an advance under a special authority, G111.</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> The economic object is recorded at this point since objects are recorded on 
an expenditure basis. Economic object 1219 is used to record the purchase of the new equipment - other machinery parts. 
" 6299 - Net Increase or Decrease to Other Liability Accounts" is used to establish the payable for the amount owing. The 
GST is reflected by using "8171 - Payment of GST on purchases". "4843 - Sales of surplus Crown assets to outside parties" 
is used in the remainder of this entry, because it relates to all the proceeds received for the asset being sold.</p><p>2) Transfer of funds (optional entry)</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">      </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR Other equipment (new)</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>600</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>16129</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>A131</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>7099</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Other equipment (new)</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>600</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>16129</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>B14*</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>7099</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>FRA coding rationale:</strong> The purpose of this entry is purely for authority purposes, there is no effect

of the lease obligation. There is no interest paid out at this point. At year-end the expense is accrued, (see journal entry 
3) below. The executory costs are coded to operating expenses. The Department must record a payable for the amount owing 
of $25,981.62 plus GST of $1,818.71.</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> (**) In this example, it is assumed this lease payment and operating expense 
would be charged to the capital vote -B14A. However, depending on the departmental appropriations, the following authority 
codes could be used: B11A - Program Vote, B12A Operating Vote, and A131 Spending of amounts equivalent to proceeds from 
disposal of surplus Crown assets. As there is no impact on the authorities for accounts payable, the code would be "R300- 
All other assets and liabilities" since the system requires that a code be used. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental 
appropriation, it is set up as an advance under a special authority, G111.</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> At this point expenditures are made for the executory costs and lease costs. 
Therefore economic objects are affected. In this case, "0525-Rental of computer equipment" is used for the executory costs 
and "1221-Voice communication equipment" is used for the lease payment. "6299-Net Increase or Decrease to Other Liability 
Accounts" is used establish an accounts payable. The GST must be reflected by using "8171-Payment of GST on purchases".</p><p>Each rental payment of $25,981.62 consists of three elements: (1) a reduction in the principal of the lease obligation; 
(2) a financing cost (interest expense); and (3) executory costs. The total financing cost or interest expense over the 
term of the lease is the difference between the present value of the lease payments ($100,000) and the actual cash disbursed, 
net of executory costs ($119,908.10), or $19,908.10. <strong>Note:</strong> In the journal entry 2) above no portion of 
the 23,981.62 relates to interest expense. The interest is accrued at the end of the year, (see journal entry 3) below)

would be recorded against either B11A or B12A depending on whether the department has a program vote (B11A) or an operating

it is realized. When revenues are received prior to being realized, the amount applicable to future periods is deferred 
to those future periods.</p><p>The amount unearned or deferred (received in advance of realisation) is considered a liability because it represents

the equivalent amount will be removed from the liability account for the deferred revenue (21510).</p><p><strong>Authority Rationale:</strong> This is strictly an accrual transaction. Authorities are not affected here at all. 
However, the system requires that authority codes be input. In order to achieve a nil effect on departmental authorities 
one option would be to debit and credit the same authority for the same amount. D/E(*) Depending on which type of revenue 
is considered in the Scenario , the department would choose the appropriate code from the following chart. Note: if D211

no effect on appropriations thereby producing the same results as the above option.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale: "</strong>4888 - reallocation from non budgetary funds and accounts" must be used here since 
this is a reallocation of deferred revenue to non-tax revenue. There is no effect on the economic object at this point.

noted, that due to system limitations and requirements to charge an appropriation the debit is made to Expenses related 
to loan guarantees instead of a receivable. As a result, the Expenses related to loan guarantee is subsequently removed 
from the books by a credit in journal entry 3) see below.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> A/B(*) Depending on the Department's vote structure the following the payment 
can be charged either B11A(*) - Program Vote, B12A - Operating Vote. If a department has a specific statutory budgetary

be charged to the capital vote. However, depending on the department and the asset involved, the following authority codes 
could be used: B11A- Program vote, B12A -Operating vote, or A131 Spending of amounts equivalent to proceeds from disposal 
of surplus Crown assets. As the costs associated with the future site restoration will only be incurred in the future, "F129 
-Other amounts to be charged later" is used. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it is set up 
as an advance under a special authority, G111. There is no impact on authorities for the accounts payable and future site 
restoration costs liability hence R300 - All other assets and liabilities" is used.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> "1339- Other engineering works" is used to record the observation tower. The recording

 </td></tr></table><p>* DDD refers to department number.</p><p><strong>FRA Coding Rationale:</strong> Revenues and expenses are temporary (nominal) accounts only intended to be used 
for one fiscal period. They are intended to report a department's financial performance, which is always reported on a period-by-period 
basis. In the long term, net losses or gains are reflected in 32DDD, "Net Equity Advanced". Therefore, at the end of each 
period, the revenue and expense accounts must be "closed" to this Equity account. This is done by reducing the balance in 
the revenue and expense accounts to zero, and adding their balances to Equity. If an account carries a debit balance (like 
an Expense), it must be credited in the amount of its balance, and Equity must be debited for the same amount. So in this 
entry, all revenue accounts have been debited, because they carry credit balances, and all expense accounts have been credited 
because they carry debit balances. The difference between Revenues and Expenses is entered into the Equity account. In this 
case, there are more Expenses than Revenues, so a debit is entered.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> This is strictly an accrual transaction, so the Authority codes are not 
involved. Therefore, all amounts are coded 0000.</p><p><strong>Object Coding Rationale:</strong> This is strictly an accrual transaction, with no impact on the Objects. Therefore,

only explore non-tax revenue.</p><p>Revenues appear on the departmental Statement of Operations, where they are netted against expenses to determine the 
net cost of each business line in the department. Revenues by type are disclosed by way of a Schedule to the Financial Statements.</p><section anchor="6.1" title="6.1 Respendable versus Non-Respendable Revenue"><h4>Introduction</h4><p><strong>This section addresses non-tax revenues only.</strong> (Tax revenues are not addressed in this manual, as they 
only apply to CCRA.). Non-tax revenue transactions can be external or internal to the Government and can be <em>respendable</em> 
or <em>non-respendable</em>. Departments require specific authority to be able to respend revenues, either through a voted 
appropriation or in a statutory appropriation, or specific legislation.</p><p><em>Revenue</em> is defined as the inflow of cash, receivables or other consideration arising in the course of the ordinary 
activities of the government entity, normally from the sale of goods, the rendering of services, and the earning of interest, 
royalties and dividends. It does not include borrowings, such as debenture proceeds, or transfers from other funds or include 
repayments of loans, receivables, advances, etc.</p><p><em>Deferred Revenue</em> is defined as the inflow of cash, receivables or other consideration arising in the course 
of the ordinary activities of the government entity BEFORE the transactions or events occur that give rise to the earning 
of the revenues. (See section on Deferred Revenues) Only after the government meets the obligation for which it collected 
those funds can the transactions be recognized as actual revenue.</p><p><strong>Revenue Recognition</strong></p><p>Revenues should be accounted for in the period in which the transactions or events giving rise to the revenues occurred. 
For example, user fees are recorded in the period when the goods or services are provided, sales when the sales are made 
and revenue from cost sharing arrangements when the costs are incurred to earn that revenue. Revenues should be recognized 
based on the revenue recognition criteria set out in the CICA handbook [Section 3400.6 to 3400.15] and for administrative 
simplicity, they are normally recorded at the time the invoice is issued. However, care must be exercised when goods or 
services are provided near the end of a particular accounting period since revenues must be recognized in the period even 
though an invoice may not have been issued. This can be accomplished through setting up an accrued or accounts receivable. 
Items not practically measurable until cash is received would be accounted for at that time.

known and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and the seller has completed all significant 
acts. Once the goods have been provided, the revenue should be recorded in the Department's books, as well as the relevant 
GST and PST that is payable on the revenue. Assuming this transaction takes place in Ontario, the PST payable is calculated 
as 8% of the sale price and is a payable to the Ontario Government in accordance with the applicable provincial government 
requirements for reporting and remitting provincial sales taxes. The GST payable is calculated as 7% of the sales price 
and is payable to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. A receivable must be set up to record the amount to be received (which 
includes the GST and PST) by the outside party. Where an invoice has not been issued, an accrued receivable for an estimated

before the invoice is issued.</p><p><strong>Authority code rationale:</strong> Since there are no impacts on the authorities for payables and receivables

Other Liability Accounts" would be used. "5399 - Net Change to Accounts Receivable" is used to establish an accounts receivable. 
At this point the revenue is earned, therefore the object is affected. "4546-Sales of information products" would be used 
in this particular Scenario. However, depending on the nature of the good or service provided, the appropriate non-tax 
revenue object (45xx or 48xx) would be used.</p><h4>Scenario A 2 - Internal Transactions - Non-respendable</h4><p>There is no conceptual difference between transactions with external parties and those with other government departments 
but there are procedural differences. The major difference is that, for sales of goods and services, the billing department 
(creditor) does not have to wait for payment by the invoiced department (debtor). Instead, the creditor is deemed to have 
been paid when a transaction is processed by the Interdepartmental Settlement functionality of the Standard Payment System 
(SPS/IS). The Receiver General Manual should be consulted for more information on the Interdepartmental Settlement process.</p><p>For the purposes of the accounting transactions, there is no requirement for the creditor department (the selling department) 
to affect accounts receivable with the new FIS Interdepartmental Settlement (IS) process, and to separate the billing process 
from the settlement process for their revenue transactions. However, for the following reasons it may be advantageous to 
use the Accounts Receivable functionality of your financial system, especially if there are multiple potential sources of 
IS initiation, for example, more than one billing or invoicing system:</p><ul><li>Single point for the processing of transactions to and from SPS/IS,</li><li>Centralized record of transactions per customer,</li><li>More accurately reflects cross-year transactions (revenue earned in one fiscal year, IS initiation in the following 
  fiscal year)</li></ul><p>May facilitate reconciliation with the IS Control Accounts.</p><h4>Journal Entries</h4><p>1) Department has sold goods to another department for $500</p><div class="indent1"><p>1a) If Accounts Receivable functionality is used:</p></div><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR Other Receivables from OGD</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>11242</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>R300</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5399</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Sales of goods and information products</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>42315</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>D/E(*)</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>4546</p></td></tr></table><div class="indent1"><p>Receipt of the return file from the Standard Payment System would be used to clear the accounts receivable entry.</p></div><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR IS Debit Control Accounts</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>64DDD(**)</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>0000</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>9DDD(***)</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Other Receivables from OGD</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>11242</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>R300</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5399</p></td></tr></table><div class="indent1"><p>1b) If Accounts Receivable functionality is not used:</p></div><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR IS in Transit to RG</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>11245</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>R300</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5299</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Sales of goods and information products</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>42315</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>D/E(*)</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>4546</p></td></tr></table><div class="indent1"><p>Receipt of the return file from the Standard Payment System would be used to clear the "In Transit" account.</p></div><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR IS Debit Control Accounts</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>64DDD(**)</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>0000</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>9DDD(***)</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR IS in Transit to RG</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>500</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>11245</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>R300</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>5299</p></td></tr></table><div class="indent1"><p>(**) The DDD is the department number of the department selling the goods.</p><p>(***) The DDD is the department number of the department purchasing the goods.</p></div><p><strong>FRA Coding rationale:</strong> At this point the Department should recognize the revenue since the amount is

and adjusting for any rejected items after receipt of the appropriate return file.)</p><p><strong>Authority code rationale:</strong> D/E(*) See Scenario A1, Journal Entry 1, Authority Code Rationale. Since there

known and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer as well the seller has completed all significant 
acts. Once the goods have been provided, the revenue should be recorded in the Department's books, as well as the relevant 
GST and PST that is payable on the revenue. Assuming this transaction takes place in Ontario, the PST payable is calculated 
as 8% of the sale price and is a payable to the Ontario Government in accordance with the applicable provincial government 
requirements for reporting and remitting provincial sales taxes. The GST payable is calculated as 7% of the sales price 
and is payable to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. A receivable must be set up to record the amount to be received (which 
includes the GST and PST) by the outside party. Where an invoice has not been issued, an accrued receivable for an estimated 
amount should be set up using FRA 11223, but ignoring the GST and PST payable.</p><p><strong>Authority code rationale:</strong> Since there are no impacts on the authorities for payables and receivables

no effect on FRAs, the same FRA is debited and credited for the same amount.</p><p><strong>Authority rationale:</strong> When a Department has authority to re-spend revenue, it can only be respent when 
the revenue is actually received (i.e. on a cash basis). Only the revenue portion of the transaction is affected-in this 
case, $500. To reflect this, the cash received is credited to "B13A Revenues credited to the vote". The debit will be to 
either a D218 (statutory) or E218 (non-statutory) depending on where the original sale was recorded. It is important that 
either D218 and E218 be used in this transaction and that the authority code used to set up the revenue transaction not 
be used. Otherwise, information on the revenue charging authorities would be lost.</p><p><strong>Object rationale:</strong> This is strictly an authority transaction. To ensure there is no effect on objects, 
the same object, "7099- Net Increase or Decrease in Other Transactions", is debited and credited for the same amount so 
it will have a nil effect on objects.</p><h4>Scenario B2 - Internal Transactions - Respendable</h4><p>As with transactions with external parties, the only differences between the entries for respendable revenue and those 
for non-respendable revenue are the authority code used on the recognition of Revenue and the requirement to affect the 
authority for Revenue Credited to the Vote.</p><p>The authority code rationale in Journal Entry 1 in Scenario B1 applies to the entry to recognize revenue used in the 
first journal entry of Scenario A2, regardless of whether Accounts Receivable is used or not.</p><p>The same transaction as Journal Entry 2b of Scenario B1 must be recorded whenever the Department considers itself to 
have been "paid".</p><h4>Scenario C - Recognition of Gains on Sales of Assets</h4><p>See Tangible Capital Asset Section</p><h4>Scenario D - Interest Revenue on Overdue Receivables</h4><p>An outside party is overdue in paying their trade receivables for goods sold to them by the Department.

assured, the department will recognize $50 in interest revenue on overdue accounts receivable. Since the amount is yet to 
be received from the outside party, an accounts receivable is set up. If the department wants to separate these receivables 
from the regular receivables, FRA 11223 is available for this purpose.</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> There is no impact on authorities with respect to receivables, R300 is used. 
"E500 - All other non-tax revenue" would be used in this Scenario since there is no other specific authority to capture 
this information. It should be noted that this authority is credited on an accrual basis and not when the cash is received.</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> 5399 is used to establish an accounts receivable. "4832-Interest on overdue 
accounts receivable" is used to indicate that the revenue has been earned. If the original revenue is respendable, object 
3593 should be used instead of 4832.</p><h4>Departmental Financial Statement Presentation and Disclosure Requirements</h4><p>Revenues are to be recorded by program and business line on the Department's Statement of Operations. The amounts of

to the receipt of financial assets through gifts, bequests and donations that do not have a specified purpose. Gifts, bequests 
and donations of financial assets that are received for a specified purpose should be accounted for as a specified purpose 
account (see section 9.3).</p><p><strong>Authorities Perspective:</strong></p><p>Any amount received as a gift to the Crown without any condition or requirement as to the use of the amount shall be 
credited to the Debt Servicing Reduction Account.</p><p><strong>Accrual Accounting Perspective:</strong></p><p>Donations are treated differently depending on whether they are restricted donations or unrestricted donations.</p><p><strong>Restricted Contributions:</strong></p><p>If the external parties specify how the resources are to be used, those inflows are restricted in nature. For example, 
a third party could donate a parcel of land, conditional that a building or other structure be built on it. This would constitute 
an external restriction since the asset is restricted by agreement with the external party. Restricted contributions for 
the purchase of capital assets that will be amortized should be deferred and recognized as revenue on the same basis as 
the amortization expense relate to the acquired capital assets (CICA 4410.33).</p><p>It should be noted that a contribution restricted for the purchase of a capital asset or a contribution of the capital 
asset itself is a type of restricted contribution (CICA 4410.02(b(i))).</p><p><strong>Unrestricted Contributions:</strong></p><p>Unrestricted contributions (i.e. cash) should be recognized as revenue in the current period (CICA 4410.47).</p><p>A donated capital asset would be recorded at its fair value at the date of contribution. Fair value may be estimated 
using market or appraisal values. When an estimate of fair value cannot reasonably be made, the capital asset would be recognized 
at a nominal value (CICA 4430.09).</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><em>Policy on Specified Purpose Accounts</em> - Appendix A Section 4 (available at:

consulting fees, operating leases, etc.</p><p>In addition to the proper accrual accounting treatment, it is important to ensure that the operating expenses are charged 
to the correct appropriation or authority whether it is the program vote, operating vote, capital vote, a statutory authority, 
or a specified purpose account etc. It should also be noted that some expenses e.g. amortization, bad debts and provision 
for accumulated vacation pay are not charged to an appropriation. As well, it is important to ensure that the appropriate

for or whether the invoice has been received), the Department must record the expenses in the period by debiting "51321-Operating 
Expenses". The consulting fees are recorded as operating expenses. Either a payable must be set up to record the amount 
owing by the Department or an accrued liability if it is for an estimated amount (in this case GST would not be recorded). 
In this example, it is assumed that the Department has been invoiced and hence is being charged GST on the consulting fees 
and must pay it to the vendor. However, as the Department will eventually recover this amount from Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency (CCRA) they should record it as an asset in "13392 GST/HST Refundable advance accounts".</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> (**) Once the service has been received, (regardless of when it is paid 
for or whether the invoice has been received), the Department would charge an appropriation (either the Program vote - B11A 
or the Operating Vote- B12A). In the event that the expense relates to a SPA, then the operating expenses would be charged 
to the appropriate non-budgetary authority. If the SPA relates to a non-statutory authority then one of the following authority 
codes would be used; P3xx, P5xx, P7xx or P8xx and if the SPA relates to a statutory authority, then either N3xx or N5xx 
would be used. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it is set up as an advance under a special 
authority, G111.</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> At this point the service has been rendered, therefore an economic object has 
to be charged. In this particular instance the expenses relate to management consulting therefore the code " 0491-Management

Canada. In some cases, the enabling legislation requires that revenues be earmarked, and that related payments and expenditures 
be charged against such revenues. In other cases, money is received for a specified purpose and is recorded in a SPA for 
authority purposes but treated like deferred revenue (a liability) for accrual accounting purposes. SPAs are classified 
either as consolidated SPAs, non-consolidated SPAs or deferred revenue SPAs in the financial statements of the Government 
of Canada.</p><ol><li>Consolidated SPAs are a restricted category of budgetary revenue and expenditures. These SPAs are consolidated as 
  the purpose for which they are established is similar in nature to departmental activities. The consolidation of these 
  accounts implies that the funds received from outside parties do not remain the property of the contributors, and the 
  transactions in the account are essentially government revenues and expenditures. Moneys received are credited to revenue 
  in the year received. The net revenue/deficit balance of these SPAs are reported separately as part of the accumulated 
  deficit (see note 5 of financial statements). Details of consolidated SPAs are presented in section 4 - Consolidated Accounts 
  of the Public Accounts. Consolidated SPAs include: budgetary insurance accounts, fees and levies imposed by statute and 
  earmarked for a special purpose, and court awards that have been specifically earmarked by the court. The principal portion 
  of an endowment is also accounted for as a consolidated SPA. The balances of these accounts appear in Financial Reporting 
  Accounts in the 312XX range. Each consolidated SPA has its own specific authority code.</li><li>Non-consolidated SPAs represent a financial obligation of the Government of Canada, either to the parties from whom 
  the funds were received, or in situations where a statutory or a contractual obligation must be recorded. Non-consolidated 
  SPAs appear as liabilities in the accounts of Canada. Details of these SPAs are presented in section 6 - Interest- Bearing 
  Debt of the Public Accounts. The expenditures and revenues of non-consolidated SPAs are recorded as decreases and increases 
  to the liability account and are not recorded as revenues and expenses of the Government of Canada. These SPAs include: 
  deposit and trust accounts; pension, insurance and death benefits accounts; federal-provincial arrangements; and certain 
  cost-sharing and joint project arrangements. The balances of these accounts appear in the Financial Reporting Accounts 
  in the 226XX, 232XX and 2344X accounts. Each non-consolidated SPA has its own specific authority code.</li><li>Deferred Revenues SPAs represent an obligation of the Government of Canada to spend funds received for their specified 
  purpose. The expenditures and revenues of the SPA are included in the revenues and expenditures of the Government of Canada 
  once the specified purpose has been completed. These SPAs include: bequests, donations, and gifts received for a specified 
  purpose; pre-payments for unspecified goods and services; the interest earned on endowment funds; and certain cost-sharing 
  and joint project arrangements. Note that up until the 2000-2001 year-end, bequests, donations, gifts, and the interest 
  earned on endowment funds were accounted for as consolidated SPAs. However, starting with fiscal year 2001-2002, the classification 
  of these SPAs has bee changed to Deferred Revenues SPAs to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The balances 
  of these accounts appear in the Financial Reporting Account 23451 - Deferred revenues - SPAs. Each deferred revenue SPA 
  has its own specific authority code.</li></ol><p>The following types of SPAs will be examined in this section:</p><ul><li>Prepayments</li><li>Endowments</li><li>Restricted Gifts, Bequests, Donations</li><li>Cost-Sharing and Joint Project Agreements</li><li>Trust Accounts</li><li>Deposit Accounts</li><li>Court Awards</li></ul><p>As noted in the section 1.2 Limitations of the Manual, it is not possible to cover all transactions and Scenario s.

the funds must be recorded as deferred revenue. However for government reporting purposes, the deferred revenue may either 
be credited to a regular deferred revenue account or a specified purpose account (SPA) depending on whether the goods or 
services to be provided are specified. Where the goods or services to be provided are specified, the money received is credited 
to a deferred revenue account and a non-tax revenue authority (see section 4.2 of the Manual for guidance). Where the goods 
or services to be provided are unspecified, the moneys received are also credited to a deferred revenue account (but specific 
to SPAs) and the authority credited is a SPA authority.</p><p>The distinction between specified and unspecified goods and services is important for spending authority. Where a department 
has the authority to re-spend revenues, the following differences exist:</p><ul><li>for specified goods and services, the amount received is re-spendable when cash is received;</li><li>for unspecified goods and services, the amount received is re-spendable only when the goods or services are provided. 
  Hence the authority to spend the revenue has been deferred until it is earned.</li></ul><p>Amounts equivalent to the cost of the goods or services will be transferred from the SPA to revenue as goods or services 
are provided, just as if payment had been made at the time, as per section 6(a) and (b) of the <em>Policy on Specified Purpose 
Accounts.</em></p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12249">Policy on Specified Purpose Accounts</a></em> - Appendix A Section 6</li><li>PSA 3100.11</li><li>CICA 4410.31</li></ul><h4>Scenario A</h4><p>Department enters in an agreement with a 3<sup>rd</sup> party to provide goods and services of an unspecified nature

department prior to the Department providing the goods or services, the entire amount of the receipts should be recorded

reduced and the equivalent amount would be credited to the appropriate revenue account (excluding the GST and PST). The 
GST and PST are charged directly to the SPA for the portion of expenditures incurred by the SPA, therefore $5,750 (1.15 
x $5,000) is recorded. The GST and PST would be accrued as a payable since the amount owing has not been paid.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> As goods/services are provided the liability account is charged for their 
costs. N/P(*), the same authority code used to set up the liability account would be used in this transaction. D/E(**) as 
the goods/services are provided the revenue should be charged to any one of the applicable codes depending on the situation, 
either D211 to D213 (if a statutory authority) or E211 to E213 (if a non-statutory authority). GST payable and PST payable 
do not affect authorities, therefore R300 is used.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> The object code to use for revenue depends on the goods or services being provided. 
To record the net impact on the SPA, object "6086 - Payments made in accordance with authorities" or "6099-Net Increases

on public debt is under the Department of Finance, the entries must be recorded as O.G.D. receivables\payables until they

code established for the interest portion of the endowment. For statutory accounts, the code is in the N61x range and for 
non-statutory accounts the code is in the P41x range. The authority code is different than the code used to record the endowment 
principal due to the different accounting treatment required for the principal and interest portions of the endowment. As

it exceeds the capital asset threshold of $10,000. At this point the Department is being charged GST on the vehicle, and 
must pay it to the vendor. However, as the Department will eventually recover this amount from Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency (CCRA) it should be recorded as an asset in "13392 GST/HST Refundable advance accounts". The associated amount owed 
of $22,470 but not yet paid must be recorded in the form of a payable.</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> At this point the vehicle is being purchased with money that is held in 
the SPA. Therefore, the authority code used to record the SPA is charged the cost of the vehicle. Since GST is not to be

directly in or assign staff to a common undertaking.</p><p>Joint project agreements are arrangements whereby the parties involved agree to participate jointly in the actual carrying 
out of a project. This would involve the sharing of resources, the purchase of goods and services, the hiring of personnel, 
and so on.</p><p>A specified purpose account is required under a cost-sharing or joint project agreement <strong>only</strong> when funds 
are received in advance from the external parties to the agreement. Funds received from outside parties for the purposes 
of cost-sharing or joint project agreements must never be used to reimburse departmental expenditures; expenditures shall 
be charged directly to the account.</p><p>It is the responsibility of departments to ensure that their use of specified purpose accounts complies with the Policy 
on Specified Purpose Accounts.</p><p><strong>Accrual Accounting Perspective:</strong></p><p>There are two alternatives for accounting for the funds advanced under a cost-sharing or joint project agreement. The 
accounting treatment selected depends upon whether the funds received from the outside party are an advance to cover future 
expenses that belong to the outside party or are a contribution towards expenses to be incurred by the department.</p><p>Where the funds received are considered an advance to cover the outside party's future expenses, the specified purpose 
account would represent a liability of the department. Any expenses funded from the SPA would not be recorded in the accounts 
of Canada but would simply represent a reduction in the SPA. No revenues would be recorded in this Scenario. See Scenario 
A for the accounting entries. An example of this Scenario is where a department arranges missions overseas and invites third 
parties to participate but they must pay their own travel expenses. The third party advances funds to the department to 
pay the expenses on its behalf. It would be inappropriate for the department to recognize these funds as revenue and expenses 
as it has simply acted as a facilitator in this case.</p><p>Where the funds received are considered a contribution towards expenses to be incurred by the department, the funds would 
be recorded as deferred revenue. Expenses would be recorded in the accounts of Canada (but under the authority of the SPA) 
and revenue would be recorded to reduce the balance of the deferred revenue account. Scenario B presents an example of this 
type of agreement.</p><p>Departments should review the cost-sharing and joint project agreements to determine which accounting treatment best 
reflects the substance of the arrangement with the external party. In addition to the above, departments should consider 
the appropriateness of excluding or including the activities funded by these agreements from their financial statements. 
Under Scenario A, the receipts and disbursements related to the SPA accounts will not be recorded as revenues and expenses 
in the income statement. If SPA funds are used to pay for a significant amount of employee salaries or other internal costs, 
excluding these expenses reduces the usefulness of the income statement in conveying of the department's activities in the 
year.</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12249">Policy on Specified Purpose Accounts</a></em> - Appendix B

its share of expenses to be incurred under a scientific research project. The funds will cover the costs of hiring an external 
consultant and purchasing research equipment. This money is deposited in a SPA.</p><p>Consulting fees of $10,000 are incurred. The equipment purchased, cost $40,000 in total and has a useful life of 5 years 
and will have no residual value. The agreement specifies that the asset is to remain the property of the department at the

  with the outside party. If GST is not to be charged, the SPA account would only be charged $4,000 while the GST refundable 
  advance account would be charged $700.</p></div><p><strong>FRA Coding Rationale:</strong> Since the expense was incurred as part of a cost-sharing agreement, the Department 
would only record its share of the expense (60% of $10,000). The remaining share of the expense (40%) plus applicable taxes 
would be charged directly to the SPA liability account. The department would only charge its share of the GST to the refundable 
advance account as the outside party would pay its own taxes. The cost of the operating expenses plus 7% GST ($10,000+700) 
would be accrued as an accounts payable in the period since expenses were incurred but not yet paid.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> Authorities are charged when there is an acquisition of goods or services. 
Since consulting services have been acquired, an appropriation or other source of funding must be charged. Only $6,000 should 
be charged to the Departmental appropriation. B11A(**), in this example, the departmental portion of the acquisition of 
consulting services would be charged to either a B11A - Program Vote, or B12A Operating Vote.The $4,000 operating expenses 
not being funded from departmental appropriations is charged to the SPA. N/P(*), any one of the following statutory authorities 
can be used depending on the situation - N3xx or N5xx,or, if a non-statutory authority is required, any one of the following 
can be used depending on the situation: P3xx, P5xx, P7xx or P8xx). Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, 
authority G111 is used. Accounts payable does not impact appropriation, therefore, R300 is used.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> Since the consulting services were acquired at this point, the appropriate object 
must be used which in this case would be 04xx. "6086 - Payments made in accordance with authorities" or "6099 - Increases 
or decreases in other SPA" could be used for the expense charged to the SPA depending on whether detailed object information 
is desired. Since there has been an acquisition of services on which GST/HST is payable, the related GST must be reflected

  entry can be performed.</p></div><p><strong>FRA Coding Rationale:</strong> The asset acquired is machinery and equipment, thus FRA "16121" would be used. 
The cost recorded would only be the government's share (60% of $40,000). The SPA liability would be charged the remaining 
cost of the asset (40% of $40,000) plus GST on this balance. GST on the government's share of the purchase (7% of $24,000) 
would be charged to the refundable advance account. The cost of the capital asset plus 7% GST ($40,000+$2,800) would be 
accrued as an accounts payable in the period since expenses were incurred but not yet paid</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> Authorities are charged when there is an acquisition of goods or services. 
Since a capital asset has been acquired, an appropriation or other source of funding must be charged. Only $24,000 should 
be charged to the Departmental appropriation.</p><p>B14A (**) is used in this example, the departmental portion of the acquisition of the asset may also have been charged 
to either B14A - Capital vote, B11A - Program Vote, or B12A Operating Vote, as applicable. The $16,000 (plus GST) not being 
funded from departmental appropriations is charged to the SPA. In this case, N/P(*), either of the following Statutory votes 
can be used depending on the situation - N3xx or N5xx,or, if a non-statutory vote is required, any one of the following 
can be used depending on the situation: P3xx, P5xx, P7xx or P8xx. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, 
authority G111 is used. Accounts payable does not impact an appropriation, therefore, R300 is used.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> Since a capital asset was acquired at this point the appropriate economic object must 
be used. In this Scenario , machinery and equipment were acquired, in which case a 12xx code would be used. Since GST is 
applicable on the acquisition of an asset, the related GST must be reflected using "8171-Payment of GST on purchases". To 
record the net impact on the SPA, "6086 - Payment made in accordance with authorities" or "6099 - Increases or decreases 
in other SPAs" would be used depending on whether detailed object information was desired. "6299- Net Increase or Decrease 
to Other Liability accounts" should be used to indicate the establishment of the accounts payable.</p><p>4) Periodic amortization expense for the capital asset</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">   </th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AMT($)</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>FRA</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>AUTH</strong></p></th><th scope="col" class="alignTopRight"><p><strong>OBJ</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>DR Amortization expense</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>4,800</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>51421</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>F111</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>3451</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignTop"><p>CR Accumulated amortization-Mach. &amp; Equip.</p></th><td class="alignTopRight"><p>4,800</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>16221</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>F311</p></td><td class="alignTopRight"><p>7061/7099</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>FRA Coding Rationale:</strong> The periodic amortization expense of $4,800 is calculated as follows ($24,000/5years) 
It should be noted that the amortization expense is calculated on the cost incurred by the department for the purchase of 
the asset. See Section on Tangible Capital Assets for additional coding rationale.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> See Section on Tangible Capital Assets for coding rationale.</p><p><strong>Object Rationale:</strong> See Section on Tangible Capital Assets for coding rationale.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> At the end of the project, the department is allowed to keep the asset under the terms of the 
agreement. The department may choose to record the external party's share of the fair value of the asset as a donated asset 
(at the end of the agreement term). See section 6.2 for accounting entries related to donated assets.</p><h4>Scenario B</h4><p>A department has planned a research project with an estimated cost of $500,000. It enters into an agreement with an outside 
party which calls for the latter to perform the equivalent of $50,000 of research at its own facilities and expense and 
to contribute $100,000 towards any direct expenses incurred by the department on the research project. The agreement does 
not specify which costs are to be paid out of the funds. The outside party will share in the results of the research.</p><p>In this case, the $100,000 provided by the outside party is towards the department's expenses under the research project. 
Hence it would be preferable for the department to reflect the $100,000 received as deferred revenue and record the expenses 
in their accounts. As the expenses are incurred, revenue would be recorded and the deferred revenue account reduced. The 
accounting for the transactions would be identical to those performed in section 9.1.3 for donations and bequests. The only 
the exception is that the revenue account used would be FRA 42734 Revenue from cost-sharing and joint-project agreements 
instead of 42725 Donations and bequest revenue.</p><h4>Departmental Financial Statement Presentation and Disclosure Requirements</h4><p>Amounts recorded under cost-sharing agreements will be recorded under the heading Liabilities in the Department's Statement 
of Financial Position. The agreements will either be reflected as liabilities or deferred revenues depending on the accounting 
treatment selected.</p><p>In the notes to the Departmental financial statements, a description of cost-sharing arrangement is to be disclosed.</p><h4>9.1.5 Trust Accounts</h4><h4>Introduction</h4><p><strong>Authorities Perspective (Policy on Specified Purpose Accounts):</strong></p><p>Trust accounts are established to record the deposit of money in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or the receipt of securities, 
when these funds must be administered by the Government of Canada according to specific terms and conditions of a trust 
agreement or legislation establishing a fiduciary relationship. The funds remain the property of the beneficiary and consequently 
represent a financial obligation of the Government of Canada.</p><p>Transactions recorded in a trust account are limited as follows:</p><ul><li>The receipts and credits will consist of cash and securities received from outside parties or of benefits (and interest, 
  if applicable) payable to beneficiaries directly by the government;</li><li>Charges and payments are limited to the balance in the account and may only be made to or on behalf of the beneficiary, 
  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the trust agreement. When authorized by the legislation or the trust agreement, 
  administrative fees can be also charged to the account.</li></ul><p><strong>Accrual Accounting Perspective:</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding PSAB 1300.33, Departments will record trusts as a liability. This is in compliance with section 21 of 
the FAA.</p><p>Government financial statements should disclose, in a note or schedule, a description of trusts under administration 
by a government or government organization, and a summary of trust balances.</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12249">Policy on Specified Purpose Accounts</a></em> - Appendix A

public debt is under the Department of Finance, the entries must be recorded as O.G.D. receivables\payables until they are 
settled via the IS process.</p><p><strong>Authority Coding Rationale:</strong> As interest is earned on the trust, it will be charged against "A701-Interest 
on unmatured debt" by the Department of Finance. The earnings of the trust will be credited to the same authority as when

purposes.</p><p><strong>Accrual Accounting Perspective:</strong></p><p>Since the legislation is to be respected, the amount of the court award is not a true liability but is more an earmarking 
of the Net Assets/Liabilities (restricted equity). There are a series of special revenue and expense accounts that will 
get closed separately at year-end into a relevant equity account. With respect to court awards, the funds will flow through 
a specific revenue account (FRA 42635), payments will flow out of specific expense account (FRA 51635) and will subsequently 
get closed out to the related restricted net asset/liability account (FRA 31235) at year end. (see Net Asset/Liabilities 
section of the manual for examples of how these revenues and expenses are closed into restricted net assets/liabilities).</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12249">Policy on Specified Purpose Accounts</a></em> - Appendix A Section 7</li><li>PS 3100 Restricted assets and revenues</li></ul><h4>Scenario A - A company is fined and money goes into SPA</h4><p>The courts have found a company guilty of destroying a fish habitat.

as a restricted asset. The nature, amounts and terms of the court awards should be disclosed in the notes to the financial 
statements.</p></section><section anchor="9.2" title="9.2 Foreign Currency Transactions"><h4>Introduction</h4><p>The Government of Canada's accounting policies are generally consistent with the recommendations of the CICA HB, where 
applicable. However, there is an exception with respect to the recognition of exchange gains and losses on long-term foreign 
currency denominated monetary items. The CICA recommends the deferral and amortization of such gains and losses while the 
Government accounting policy is to include these in net income for the current period.</p><p><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions</strong></p><p>Once foreign currency purchases, sales, inventories, fixed assets or other non-monetary items obtained through foreign 
currency transactions, have been translated and recorded, any subsequent changes in the exchange rate will not affect those 
recorded amounts. CICA 1650.13</p><p>Each asset, liability, revenue or expense arising from a foreign currency transaction should be translated into Canadian 
dollars by the rate of exchange in effect at the transaction date. For example, the transaction date would be the date a 
department would establish a payable on their books as result of purchases made in foreign currencies.</p><p>Departments will record transactions at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction day. This rate could vary with 
the rate in effect on the date the department requisitions the RG for payment. Therefore, on the date of requisition, the 
departments need to record an exchange gain or loss to reflect the differences in exchange rates.</p><p><strong>Restatement at Year-end</strong></p><p>As at March 31, all <strong>monetary items</strong> denominated in a foreign currency shall be adjusted to reflect the 
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Monetary items can be defined as money and claims to money.</p><p>For example, when the department purchases or sells goods or services on credit with settlement to be in a foreign currency, 
this will give rise to a payable or receivable in that foreign currency. The receivable or payable should be re-measured 
at the equivalent amount of Canadian dollars that would be collected or paid as at March 31.</p><p>Non-monetary items are not restated at March 31, but are recorded and maintained at historical exchange rates (the exchange 
rate in effect at the transaction date).</p><p><strong>Exchange Gains and Losses</strong></p><p><strong>Exchange gains or losses arising on translation or settlement of a foreign currency denominated monetary item 
should be included in the determination of net income for the current period.</strong></p><h4>References</h4><ul><li>CICA 1650</li></ul><h4>Scenario A - Foreign Currency Transactions - Loss</h4><p>Department has purchased goods from a U.S firm for $50,000 USD.

Sales Tax (HST). The HST is calculated at 15% of the sales price and this whole amount is payable to CCRA. In PEI and provinces 
west of Quebec (except Alberta where there is no PST), the PST payable is calculated as a percentage of the sales price 
(in Ontario it is 8%). It is payable to the provincial government in accordance with applicable provincial government requirements 
for reporting and remitting provincial sales taxes. In Quebec, the QST is calculated as a percentage on the total of the

books, as well as the relevant GST and PST that is payable on the revenue. Assuming this transaction takes place in Ontario, 
the PST payable is calculated as 8% of the sale price and is a payable to the Ontario Government in accordance with the 
applicable provincial government requirements for reporting and remitting provincial sales taxes. The GST payable is calculated 
as 7% of the sales price and is payable to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. A receivable must be set up to record the 
amount to be received (which includes the GST and PST) by the outside party. Where an invoice has not been issued, an accrued 
receivable for an estimated amount should be set up using FRA 11223 and ignoring the GST and PST payable. This accrual can 
be reversed in the next period before the invoice is issued.</p><p><strong>Authority code rationale:</strong> Since there are no impacts on the authorities for payables and receivables

since the cost is above the $10,000 threshold. Departments are to record the GST or HST due to the suppliers at the same 
time as the related goods or services are recorded to the departmental accounting system. The GST/HST due will be recorded 
in the Refundable Advance Account. The full amount of the invoice will be recorded as an account payable. To further clarify, 
the Department is being charged GST on the vehicle, and must pay it to the vendor. However, as the Department will eventually 
recover this amount from Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) they should record it as an asset in "13392 GST/HST Refundable 
advance accounts". Since the Department has not paid for the vehicle, a liability must be recorded for the amount owing. 
It should be noted that the Federal Government does not pay Provincial Sales Tax (PST) on goods and services that it purchases.</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> (*) In this example it is assumed this purchase would be charged to the 
capital vote. However, depending on the department and the asset purchased, the following authority codes could be used: 
B11A - Program Vote, B12A Operating Vote, or A131 Spending of amounts equivalent to proceeds from disposal of surplus Crown 
assets. Since GST is not to be charged to a departmental appropriation, it is set up as an advance under a special authority, 
G111. There is no impact on authorities for the accounts payable so the code to be used would be "R300-All other assets 
and liabilities"</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> Economic object 1261 is used in this example since the purchase was a motor 
vehicle. The appropriate economic object is used depending on the nature of the purchase. Since there is GST/HST payable, 
the GST must be reflected by using, "8171-Payment of GST on purchases". "6299-Net Increase or Decrease to Other Liability

This is done through a credit to the GST RAA and a corresponding debit to the IS Debit Control Account. Departments are 
to transfer these amounts to CCRA on the last working day of March so that CCRA can prepare the Tax Remission Order to authorize 
them to deduct these amounts from the GST Tax Revenue accounts at year-end.</p><p><strong>Authority coding rationale:</strong> There is no impact on appropriations with respect to the receipt of cash 
and accounts receivable, R300 is used. Now that GST is being transferred to CCRA the appropriation G111 must be credited.</p><p><strong>Object coding rationale:</strong> Since this an IS payment to CCRA (tax revenue only) 9122 is used. , "8171-Payment 
of GST on purchases" is credited since the GST is transferring to CCRA.</p><h4>Departmental Financial Statement and Presentation Disclosure Requirements</h4><p>Any GST/HST payable not transferred to CCRA will be recorded as a payable under the liabilities section of the Department's

confirm the acquisition of an asset or the reduction of a liability or the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence 
of a liability.</p><p>Departments and agencies might have contingent liabilities as a result of activities, such as: guarantees of the indebtedness 
of others; claims and pending or threatened litigation; arrangements with international organizations; and insurance programs.</p><p>The uncertainty relating to the future event, which determines the outcome of a contingency, can be expressed by a range

set up a liability once the criteria of the PAYE policy has been met.</p><p><strong>Contingent Gains:</strong> Contingent gains should not be accrued in financial statements as this accounting 
treatment could result in the recognition of revenue which might never be realized. Nevertheless, disclosure of the existence 
of a contingent gain which is considered likely to be realized provides useful information and would, therefore, be included 
in the financial statements.</p><h4>Departmental Financial Statement and Presentation Disclosure Requirements</h4><p>Departments and agencies will disclose information in their financial statements to describe their contingencies at the

or passing legislation) and the fulfilment of the requirements of the agreement by one or more parties, creating an obligation 
to perform on the part of the remaining party or parties.</p><p>The most common example of a commitment is contracting for goods or services. Once the contract between the department 
and the supplier has been signed, there is a commitment on the part of the department to perform its part of the contract, 
which, generally, is pay the supplier. The commitment exists until the supplier has performed their part of the contract, 
(i.e., delivered goods or services of a specified nature and/or quality, etc). Once goods or services are received, a commitment 
ceases to exist and the department has an obligation or liability to pay the supplier.</p><p>There may be a fair amount of financial system activity in accounting for commitments. This activity is primarily for 
budget control and to ensure that overspending does not occur. None of the entries involve financial statement classifications 
(asset, liability, expense, revenue or equity) and so should not be termed journal entries but rather memo entries.</p><p>Although committed amounts do not appear on the face of the financial statements, it is necessary to properly present

are found in TBAS 1.2 Departmental and Agency Financial Statements. It is important to understand that these statements 
require professional judgement in their preparation and therefore cannot be produced by simply activating a command in a 
software package. The Statement of Financial Position and the Statement of Operations are largely mathematical and well 
suited for automation, but the Notes to the Financial Statements are mostly text based, and must be written by personnel 
who understand the department's financial statements.</p><h4>Reference</h4><ul><li>TBAS 1.2 Departmental and Agency Financial Statements</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="11" title="Lexicon"><p><strong>Accrual basis of accounting:</strong> recognizes the effect of transactions and events in the period in which 
the transactions and events occur, regardless of whether there has been a receipt or payment of cash or its equivalent. 
Accrual accounting encompasses deferrals that occur when a cash receipt or payment occurs prior to the criteria for recognition 
of revenue or expense being satisfied. (CICA 1000.46)</p><p><strong>Amortization:</strong> the allocation of the historical cost of a capital asset over its useful life. Commonly 
referred to as depreciation.</p><p><strong>Appropriation:</strong> any authority of Parliament to pay money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. (FAA - 
definitions)</p><p><strong>Asset:</strong> An economic resource controlled by a government as a result of past transactions or events and 
from which future economic benefits may be obtained.</p><p>Assets have three essential characteristics:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>they embody a future benefit that involves a capacity, singly, or in combination with other assets to provide future 
  net cash flows, or to provide goods and services;</li><li>the government can control access to the benefit; and</li><li>the transaction or event giving rise to the government's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred. 
  (PS 3150.04)</li></ol><p><strong>Bargain purchase option:</strong> a provision allowing the lessee, at its option, to purchase the leased property 
for a price which is sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property, at the date the option becomes exercisable, 
that exercise of the option appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. (CICA 3065.03)</p><p><strong>Bargain renewal option:</strong> a provision allowing the lessee, at its option, to renew the lease for a rental 
which is sufficiently lower than the expected fair rental of the property, at the date the option becomes exercisable, that 
exercise of the option appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. "Fair rental" means the going rate 
for rental of equivalent property under similar terms and conditions. (CICA 3065.03)</p><p><strong>Betterment or Improvement:</strong> The cost incurred to enhance the service potential of a capital asset is 
a betterment. Service potential may be enhanced when there is an increase in the previously assessed service capacity, associated 
operating costs are lowered, the useful life is extended, or the quality of output is improved. The cost incurred in the 
maintenance of the service potential of a capital asset is a repair, not a betterment. If a cost has the attributes of both 
a repair and a betterment, the portion considered to be a betterment is included in the cost of the capital asset. (CICA 
4430.15)</p><p><strong>Capital Asset:</strong> comprising property, plant and equipment and intangible properties, are identifiable 
assets that meet all of the following criteria:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>are held for use in the production or supply of goods and services, for rental to others, for administrative purposes 
  or for the development, construction, maintenance or repair of other capital assets;</li><li>have been acquired, constructed or developed with the intention of being used on a continuing basis; and</li><li>are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of business. (CICA 3060.04)</li></ol><p><strong>Capital lease:</strong> a lease that, from the point of view of the lessee, transfers substantially all the benefits 
and risks incident to ownership of property to the lessee. (CICA 3065.03)</p><p><strong>Completed contract method:</strong> a method of accounting that recognizes revenue only when the sale of goods 
or the rendering of services under a contract is completed or substantially completed. (CICA 3400.04)</p><p><strong>Contingency:</strong> the result of existing conditions or situations involving uncertainty that will ultimately 
be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Resolution of the uncertainty may confirm the acquisition 
of an asset or the reduction of a liability or the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability. Contingencies 
result from such matters as pending or threatened litigation, guarantees of the indebtedness of others, indemnities and 
provisions related to insurance programs. They also include grants or contributions that are recoverable if certain future 
events occur or fail to occur. (PS 1500.69)</p><p><strong>Contingent liability:</strong> a potential liability which may become an actual liability if one or more future 
events occur or fail to occur.</p><p><strong>Contract:</strong> an agreement between two or more parties that has clear economic consequences that the parties 
have little, if any, discretion to avoid, usually because the agreement is enforceable at law. Contracts, and thus financial 
instruments, may take a variety of forms and need not be in writing. (CICA 3860.06)</p><p><strong>Contractual commitment:</strong> A contractual commitment represents a legal obligation to outside organizations 
or individuals as a result of a contract. The nature of Government activities requires negotiation of contracts that are 
significant in relation to its current financial position or that will materially affect the level of future expenditures. 
In the case of contractual commitments to international organizations, some will result in future budgetary expenditures 
while others will result in non-budgetary payments. (Public Accounts of Canada, 1999)</p><p><strong>Deferred Revenue:</strong> A local government may receive amounts before the transactions or events occur that 
give rise to the revenues. Those amounts should not be included in revenue, but would be considered a deferred revenue until 
the local government discharges the obligations that led to the collection of the funds. For example, depending on the underlying 
agreements or legislation, some development charges and other contributions may be deferred revenues. (PS 1800.40)</p><p><strong>Depreciation:</strong> see Amortization</p><p><strong>Designated assets:</strong> assets that have been formally designated by the government to indicate the government's 
intention to use those assets for a specific purpose. (PS 3100.04)</p><p><strong>Executory Costs:</strong> costs related to the operation of the leased property (e.g., insurance, maintenance 
cost and property taxes). (CICA 3065.03)</p><p><strong>Expenditure:</strong> Expenditures are the cost of goods and services acquired in the period whether or not payment 
has been made or invoices received and include transfer payments due where no value is received directly in return. (PS 
1500.88)</p><p><strong>Expense:</strong> Expenses are the cost of resources consumed in and identifiable with the operations of the 
accounting period. (PS 1500.93)</p><p><strong>External restrictions:</strong> External restrictions are stipulations imposed by an agreement with an external 
party, or through legislation of another government, that specify the purpose or purposes for which resources are to be 
used. (PS 3100.04)</p><p><strong>Extraordinary item:</strong> items which result from transactions or events that have all of the following characteristics:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>they are not expected to occur frequently over several years;</li><li>they do not typify the normal business activities of the entity; and</li><li>they do not depend primarily on decisions or determinations by management or owners. (CICA 3480.02)</li></ol><p><strong>Fair value:</strong> the amount of the consideration that would be agreed upon in an arm's length transaction 
between knowledgeable, willing parties who are under no compulsion to act. (PS 2510.04)</p><p><strong>Government's (lessee) rate for incremental borrowing</strong> the interest rate that, at the inception of the 
lease, the government would have incurred to borrow, over a similar term and with similar security for the borrowing, the 
funds necessary to purchase the leased property. (PS Handbook Appendix A - Glossary)</p><p><strong>Interest rate implicit in the lease:</strong> the discount rate that, at the inception of the lease, causes the 
aggregate present value of:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>the minimum lease payments, from the standpoint of the lessor, excluding that portion of the payments representing 
  executory costs to be paid by the lessor and any profit on such costs; and</li><li>the unguaranteed residual value accruing to the benefit of the lessor to be equal to the fair value of the leased 
  property to the lessor at the inception of the lease. (CICA 3065.03)</li></ol><p><strong>Internally restricted entities:</strong> Internally restricted entities are separate legal entities, within the 
government reporting entity, created by the government's own legislation. This legislation establishes an accountability 
relationship with parties external to the government reporting entity to use the entity's assets or net assets as specified 
while that legislation is in effect. Such legislation stipulates, either explicitly or implicitly through the terms of the 
legislation, that:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>the entity's revenues, which are derived principally from identified parties external to the government reporting 
  entity in exchange for specified goods or services, can only be used to provide those goods and services; and</li><li>the government cannot use the assets or net assets of the entity for a purpose other than providing the goods and 
  services for which the resources were received. (PS 3100.04)</li></ol><p><strong>Lease term:</strong> the fixed non-cancellable period of the lease plus:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>all periods covered by bargain renewal options;</li><li>all periods for which failure to renew would impose on the lessee a penalty sufficiently large that renewal appears, 
  at the inception of the lease, reasonably assured;</li><li>all periods covered by ordinary renewal options during which the lessee has undertaken to guarantee the lessor's debt 
  related to the leased property;</li><li>all periods covered by ordinary renewal options preceding the date on which a bargain purchase option is exercisable; 
  and</li><li>all periods representing renewals or extensions of the lease at the lessor's option;</li><li>provided that the lease term does not extend beyond the date a bargain purchase option becomes exercisable. (CICA 
  3065.03)</li></ol><p><strong>Liability:</strong> Liabilities are financial obligations to outside organizations and individuals as a result 
of transactions and events on or before the accounting date. They are the result of contracts, agreements and legislation 
in force at the accounting date that require the government to repay borrowings or to pay for goods and services acquired 
or provided prior to the accounting date. They also include transfer payments due even where no value is received directly 
in return. (PS 1500.39)</p><p><strong>Loan Guarantees:</strong> a contingent liability of the government. The generally accepted accounting principles 
for contingent liabilities are, therefore, appropriate for loan guarantees. The key accounting principles for contingent 
liabilities are disclosure of contingent liabilities in the notes to the financial statements and recognition of liabilities 
when it is determined that losses are likely. (PS 3310.04)</p><p>Loan guarantees are a significant tool that governments use to achieve policy objectives. Loan guarantees may be used, 
for example, to allow organizations to obtain lower cost financing, to support regional development or to give economic 
assistance to certain industries or to individuals who meet specific criteria. Federal, provincial, territorial and local 
governments may extend loan guarantees to individuals, organizations and other governments, under programs that apply to 
a large number of borrowers operating in similar circumstances, or on an individual "ad hoc" basis. (PS 3310.01)</p><p><strong>Net Assets and Liabilities:</strong> the difference between total assets and liabilities. When the total assets 
exceed total liabilities, the resulting amount represents Net Assets. When total liabilities exceed total assets, the resulting 
amount represents Net Liabilities.</p><p><strong>Operating lease:</strong> a lease in which the lessor does not transfer substantially all the benefits and risks 
incident to ownership of property. (CICA 3065.03)</p><p><strong>Percentage of completion method:</strong> a method of accounting that recognizes revenue proportionately with 
the degree of completion of goods or services under a contract. (CICA 3400.05)</p><p><strong>Public Money:</strong> all money belonging to Canada received or collected by the Receiver General or any other 
public officer in his official capacity or any person authorized to receive or collect such money, and includes:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>duties and revenues of Canada,</li><li>money borrowed by Canada or received through the issue or sale of securities,</li><li>money received or collected for or on behalf of Canada, and</li><li>all money that is paid to or received or collected by a public officer under or pursuant to any Act, trust, treaty, 
  undertaking or contract, and is to be disbursed for a purpose specified in or pursuant to that Act, trust, treaty, undertaking 
  or contract;</li></ol><p>(FAA - definitions)</p><p><strong>Residual value:</strong> the estimated net realizable value of a tangible capital asset at the end of its useful 
life to a government. (PS 3150.04)</p><p><strong>Salvage value:</strong> Salvage value is the estimated net realizable value of a capital asset at the end of 
its life. Salvage value is normally negligible. (CICA 3060.15)</p><p><strong>Service potential:</strong> the output or service capacity of a tangible capital asset, and is normally determined 
by reference to attributes such as physical output capacity, quality of output, associated operating costs, and useful life. 
(PS 3150.04)</p><p><strong>Tangible capital assets:</strong> non-financial assets having physical substance that are acquired, constructed 
or developed and:</p><ol class="lower-roman"><li>are held for use in the production or supply of goods and services;</li><li>have useful lives extending beyond an accounting period and are intended to be used on a continuing basis; and</li><li>are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of operations. (PS 3150.04)</li></ol><p><strong>Useful life:</strong> the estimate of either the period over which a tangible capital asset is expected to be 
used by a government, or the number of production or similar units that can be obtained from the tangible capital asset 
by a government. The life of a tangible capital asset may extend beyond the useful life of a tangible capital asset to a 
government. The life of a tangible capital asset, other than land, is finite, and is normally the shortest of the physical, 
technological, commercial, and legal life.
