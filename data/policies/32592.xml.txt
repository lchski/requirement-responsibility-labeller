institution as identified in section 9 of this Directive pursuant to powers conferred by an Act of Parliament or an order made pursuant to a prerogative of the Crown that affects legal rights, privileges or interests.</dd><dt>Algorithmic Impact Assessment</dt><dd>A framework to help institutions better understand and reduce the risks associated with Automated Decision Systems and to provide the appropriate governance, oversight and reporting/audit requirements that best match the type of application being designed. </dd><dt>Artificial Intelligence</dt><dd>Information technology that performs tasks that would ordinarily require biological brainpower to accomplish, such as making sense of spoken language, learning behaviours, or solving problems. </dd><dt>Automated Decision System</dt><dd>Includes any technology that either assists or replaces the judgement of human decision-makers. These systems draw from fields like statistics, linguistics, and computer science, and use techniques such as rules-based systems, regression, predictive analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and neural nets.</dd><dt>Procedural Fairness</dt><dd>Procedural fairness is a guiding principle of governmental and quasi-judicial decision-making. The degree of procedural fairness that the law requires for any given decision-making process increases or decreases with the significance of that decision and its impact on rights and interests. </dd><dt>Source Code</dt><dd>Computer program in its original programming language, human readable, before translation into object code usually by a compiler or an interpreter. It consists of algorithms, computer instructions and may include developer's comments.</dd><dt>Test Environment</dt><dd>An environment containing hardware, instrumentation, simulators, software tools, and other support elements needed to conduct a test. </dd></dl></section></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B - Impact Assessment Levels"><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><thead><tr class="active"><th scope="col">Level</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row"><abbr title="1">I</abbr></th><td><p>The decision will likely have little to no impact on:</p><ul><li>the rights of individuals or communities,</li><li>the health or well-being of individuals or communities,</li><li>the economic interests of individuals, entities, or communities,</li><li>the ongoing sustainability of an ecosystem.</li></ul><p>Level <abbr title="1">I</abbr> decisions will often lead to impacts that are reversible and brief.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><abbr title="2">II</abbr></th><td><p>The decision will likely have moderate impacts on:</p><ul><li>the rights of individuals or communities,</li><li>the health or well-being of individuals or communities,</li><li>the economic interests of individuals, entities, or communities,</li><li>the ongoing sustainability of an ecosystem.</li></ul><p>Level <abbr title="2">II</abbr> decisions will often lead to impacts that are likely reversible and short-term.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><abbr title="3">III</abbr></th><td><p>The decision will likely have high impacts on:</p><ul><li>the rights of individuals or communities,</li><li>the health or well-being of individuals or communities,</li><li>the economic interests of individuals, entities, or communities,</li><li>the ongoing sustainability of an ecosystem.</li></ul><p>Level <abbr title="3">III</abbr> decisions will often lead to impacts that can be difficult to reverse, and are ongoing.</p></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><abbr title="4">IV</abbr></th><td><p>The decision will likely have very high impacts on:</p><ul><li>the rights of individuals or communities,</li><li>the health or well-being of individuals or communities,</li><li>the economic interests of individuals, entities, or communities,</li><li>the ongoing sustainability of an ecosystem.</li></ul><p>Level <abbr title="4">IV</abbr> decisions will often lead to impacts that are irreversible, and are perpetual.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C - Impact Level Requirements"><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"><thead><tr class="active"><th id="tbl5">Requirement</th><th id="tbl6">Level <abbr title="1">I</abbr></th><th id="tbl7">Level <abbr title="2">II</abbr></th><th id="tbl8">Level <abbr title="3">III</abbr></th><th id="tbl9">Level <abbr title="4">IV</abbr></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th class="active" id="tbl13" headers="tbl5">Peer Review</th><td headers="tbl6 tbl13"><p>None</p></td><td colspan="2" headers="tbl7 tbl8 tbl13"><p><strong>At least one of:</strong></p><p>Qualified expert from a federal, provincial, territorial or municipal government institution</p><p>Qualified members of faculty of a post-secondary institution</p><p>Qualified researchers from a relevant non- governmental organization</p><p>Contracted third-party vendor with a related specialization</p><p>Publishing specifications of the Automated Decision System in a peer-reviewed journal</p><p>A data and automation advisory board specified by Treasury Board Secretariat</p></td><td headers="tbl9 tbl13"><p><strong>At least two of:</strong></p><p>Qualified experts from the National Research Council of Canada,Â  Statistics Canada, or the Communications Security Establishment</p><p>Qualified members of faculty of a post-secondary institution</p><p>Qualified researchers from a relevant non- governmental organization</p><p>Contracted third-party vendor with a related specialization</p><p>A data and automation advisory board specified by Treasury Board Secretariat</p><p><strong>OR:</strong></p><p>Publishing specifications of the Automated Decision System in a peer-reviewed journal</p></td></tr><tr><th class="active" id="tbl27" headers="tbl5">Notice</th><td headers="tbl6 tbl27"><p>None</p></td><td headers="tbl7 tbl27"><p>Plain language notice posted on the program or service website.</p></td><td colspan="2" headers="tbl8 tbl9 tbl27"><p>Publish documentation on relevant websites about the automated decision system, in plain language, describing:</p><ul><li>How the components work;</li><li>How it supports the administrative decision;
