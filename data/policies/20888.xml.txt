by the accounting policies of the Government of Canada, which are based on the accounting 
standards set by the Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB) and by the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12042">Policy on Management of Real Property</a></em> 
and its associated directives, standards and guides and its relevant legislation. 
Future Asset Restoration Liabilities are not remediation liabilities. Accounting 
and disclosure requirements for these costs can be found in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20885">Future Asset 
Restoration Liability guideline</a>. </p><p>This section provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, disclosure and 
reporting of a contaminated site in the <em><a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/txt/72-eng.html">Public Accounts of 
Canada</a></em>. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="Recognition"><p>A liability for remediation of contaminated sites should be recognized when, 
as at the financial reporting date, the following applies:</p><ul><li>An environmental standard exists; </li><li>Contamination exceeds the environmental standard;</li><li>The government:
	<ul><li>owns the land; or</li><li>is directly responsible; or </li><li>accepts responsibility (e.g. when there is little, if any, discretion 
		to avoid the obligation).</li></ul></li><li>It is expected that future economic benefits will be given up; and </li><li>A reasonable estimate of the amount can be made. </li></ul><p>An obligation for remediation of contaminated sites cannot be recognized as a 
liability unless all criteria are satisfied. See <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20888&amp;section=text#appB">Appendix B</a> 
for a Decision Matrix on Recognizing a Remediation Liability. </p><p>A general policy intention to remediate is not sufficient to establish a liability 
where no public health and safety concerns or contractual arrangements, legislation, 
regulation or by-law exist<em>. </em></p><p>The <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12047">Reporting Standard on Real Property</a></em> 
specifies that the Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory (FCSI) is the Government 
of Canada's central database containing all known or suspected contaminated sites 
for which departments, agencies and consolidated Crown corporations assume partial 
or full responsibility. Information in the FCSI supports the amounts reported in 
the <em>Public Accounts of Canada</em> related to the government's liabilities for 
remediation of contaminated sites. Please see <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20888&amp;section=text#appC">Appendix C</a> 
for further information on the FCSI.</p><section anchor="2.1" title="Environmental standard: "><p>An environmental standard is generally set out in the form of a statute, regulation, 
by-law, order, permit, contract or agreement. It is legally enforceable. </p><p>An environmental standard may be both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative 
standards are normally easily verifiable, whereas qualitative standards will require 
professional judgment to determine whether a liability exists. </p><p>In some cases environmental standards may be created by internal government policy 
or by guidelines developed by organizations external to the government. Voluntary 
compliance to such standards may create a liability. The determination would 
require the exercise of professional judgment considering the individual circumstances 
and the criteria for recognition of a remediation liability.</p></section><section anchor="2.2" title="Contamination exceeds the environmental standard:"><p>The existence of an environmental standard does not create a remediation liability. 
A remediation liability may only exist once it has been determined that contamination 
exceeds the standard. </p></section><section anchor="2.3" title="Government owns the land:"><p>If the government owns the land, and all other recognition criteria have been 
satisfied, a remediation liability should be recorded. If the government is 
not responsible for the contamination, and a recovery is likely, the recovery receivable 
should be recorded against the liability.</p></section><section anchor="2.4" title="Government is directly responsible: "><p>In some cases, the Government of Canada is directly responsible for remediation 
because of its own past activities or the activities on government-owned land or 
on land that the government has since acquired and a responsible party cannot be 
identified.</p><p>A legal obligation establishes a clear duty or responsibility to another party 
that justifies recognition of a liability. For purposes of this section, a legal 
obligation can result from the following:</p><ul><li>Agreements or contracts;</li><li>Another government's legislation; or</li><li>Federal government's own legislation. </li></ul></section><section anchor="2.5" title="Government accepts responsibility:"><p>The Government of Canada may voluntarily assume responsibility for remediation 
of contaminated sites through its own actions or promises. However, only those assumed 
obligations for remediation that meet the definition of a liability at the financial 
statement date can be recognized. Obligations that are based on the intention or 
policy of the government may not satisfy the three essential characteristics of 
a liability for recognition according to Public Sector Accounting Standard (PSAS) 
PS 3200.</p><p>Most liabilities for remediation arise from legal obligations, which can be enforced 
by a court of law. It is possible, in the absence of a legally enforceable 
agreement that the government, through its own actions or promises, may have created 
a valid expectation among others that it will remediate a contaminated site or continue 
to remediate contaminated sites. In these cases it may have little or no discretion 
but to take action and a liability may need to be recorded. A legal opinion may 
be required in these cases.</p></section><section anchor="2.6" title="Uncertain responsibility and contingencies:"><p>There may be a situation where the following conditions are present. An environmental 
standard exists and contamination exceeds the standard. The government is not directly 
responsible and does not accept responsibility, but there is uncertainty as to whether 
the government may be responsible. In this case, the government may have a contingent 
liability. </p><p>Determining whether a liability for a contaminated site exists atthe financial 
statement date is a matter of judgment. It requires an assessment of the probability 
that the outcome of the future event will confirm responsibility. </p><p>If it is likely that the future event will confirm the government's responsibility, 
a contingent liability would be recognized if the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
If the amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the costs are expected to be significant, 
it should be disclosed in the notes to the departmental financial statements.</p><p>If it is unlikely that the government will be responsible, no liability would 
be disclosed. </p><p>If the outcome of the future event cannot be determined, the existence, nature 
and extent of the contingent liability would be disclosed in the notes to the departmental 
financial statements. </p><p>If litigation for damages related to a contaminated site has been launched against 
the department, the claim must be reported as a contingent liability. The litigation 
liability and contingent liability should be net of any amounts reported for environmental 
liabilities and environmental contingent liabilities in this section. For additional 
information on contingencies see the
<a href="/fm-gf/tools-outils/guides/acl-cpe-eng.asp">Guidance on accounting for 
contingent liabilities stemming from claims and litigation and contingent gains</a>.</p></section><section anchor="2.7" title="Future economic benefits:"><p>The existence of contamination that exceeds an environmental standard may create 
a liability regardless of whether the government chooses to perform remediation 
activities. However, it is possible that the present obligation would not be recognized 
as a liability if it is not expected that future economic benefits will be given 
up. Professional judgment will be required.</p><p>The costs to "risk manage" a site should not be recorded as a liability unless 
the costs are directly related to reducing or removing the contaminant. Costs 
incurred to ensure the contaminant remains at an acceptable level or remains contained 
at the site are considered regular, ongoing operating costs required to manage the 
site, similar to care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Only those remediation 
expenditures required to bring the site to a "risk manageable" condition would be 
included in a remediation liability.</p><p>Where more than one department is involved with the site (i.e., more than one 
custodian is responsible for the contamination or one custodian owns the site, but 
another uses it), the custodian departmentassuming responsibility for remediation 
should report the liability.</p><p>If determining the level of responsibility for the contamination is unclear, 
departments should seek the advice of Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, Real 
Property and Materiel Policy Division.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Measurement"><p>The estimate of the remediation liability should include costs that are directly 
attributable to remediation activities and are required to bring the site up to 
the current minimum standard for federal use prior to contamination, or for the 
intended federal use, whichever is less. Costs included to bring the site up to 
a higher level would be considered a "betterment" and should be capitalized. </p><p>Directly attributable costs would include, but are not limited to, payroll and 
benefits, equipment and facilities, materials, and legal and other professional 
services. Costs related to the damage of natural resources are normally not included.</p><p>Remediation costs should include the costs to develop and implement a remediation 
strategy once the site has been reclassified as a contaminated site. Remediation 
costs would also include final confirmatory sampling and the final report. Costs 
incurred once the site has been brought to a level that is considered acceptable 
are considered regular operating costs.</p><p>The estimate may include costs of assets acquired as part of remediation activities 
to the extent that the assets have no alternative use. These assets would be expensed.</p><p>Care, maintenance and monitoring can be included only if they are a part of the 
remediation strategy and are completed during the remediation phase. Costs incurred 
for care, maintenance and monitoring before the remediation liability is recognized, 
or after the remediation phase is complete, are considered operating costs.</p><p>The measurement technique adopted by the government should result in the best 
estimate of the amount required to settle the liability. The best estimate can be 
described as the amount that a government would rationally pay to settle or otherwise 
extinguish the liability at the financial statement date. The amount would be based 
on the best estimate of the expenditures required to complete the remediation. The 
estimate of expenditures would require professional judgment supplemented by experience, 
third party quotes and, in some cases, reports of independent experts.</p><p>Governments may estimate their liability for remediation based on an assessmentof 
a group of contaminated sites that have typical or common characteristics, such 
as similarities in historical land use, site-specific conditions, and the nature 
and extent of the contamination. Note that each site must be recorded separately 
in the FCSI. Extrapolation examples are provided in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20888&amp;section=text#appD">Appendix 
D</a>. </p><p>Estimated costs that are not incurred specifically for remediation activities, 
such as research and development of technologies (i.e., bench scale testing or demonstration 
on a small scale at field sites) or skill development programs, should not be included 
in the liability.</p><p>Any costs relating to surveying areas in order to find archaeological sites, 
excavating sites in order to recover cultural remains, and the subsequent classification, 
analysis, and preservation of the sites should not be included in the liability.</p><p>If the liability estimate is based on a future cash requirement, the estimated 
future cash flow should be discounted using the
<a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/activty/lending_-eng.asp">government of Canada lending 
rate</a> to approximate its present value.. An example of discounting can be found 
in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=20888&amp;section=text#appA">Appendix A</a>.</p><p>The liability estimate should be reviewed each year-end to reflect any changes 
in estimates. At a minimum, prior year estimates should be increased by inflation 
over the previous year. The
<a href="http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/cpis01a-eng.htm">Consumer Price Index 
(CPI)</a> would be used in these cases. </p><p>Valuation adjustment = (Opening Balance less Expenditures Reducing Liability) 
[multiplied by] CPI. </p><section anchor="3.1" title="Site reassessments:"><p>Events that may indicate a need to do a detailed reassessment of the contaminated 
sites on which the estimate of the liability is based can include, but are not limited 
to, the following:</p><ul><li>Significant technological developments;</li><li>Lapsed time since the last site assessments were completed;</li><li>New information from detailed site assessments, site characterizations, 
	or technical reviews done on similar contaminated sites; and</li><li>A change in the legislation. </li></ul></section><section anchor="3.2" title="Expected recoveries:"><p>A liability for remediation of contaminated sites should be reduced by expected 
net recoveries if the item has an appropriate basis of measurement, and a reasonable 
estimate can be made of the amount involved; and it is expected that future economic 
benefits will be obtained or given up.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Disclosure and reporting"><p>A financial statement should disclose information <strong>on an aggregate basis</strong> 
about the following:</p><ul><li>Nature of the liability;</li><li>Basis for the estimate of the liability;</li><li>Reasons for non-disclosure of a liability; and</li><li>Estimated recoveries.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="References"><ul><li><em><a href="/pubs_pol/dcgpubs/accstd/capasset-eng.asp">Treasury Board Accounting

with an estimated liability of $100,000 and analysis and indicators suggest a potential 
degree of contamination on 60% of the entire site, the total liability for the site 
can be estimated at $600,000 ($100,000 [divided by] 10% [multiplied by] 60%). The extrapolation amount is 
$500,000 ($600,000 [minus] $100,000).</p></appendix><appendix anchor="E" title="Appendix E-Glossary"><dl><dt><strong>Contaminants</strong></dt><dd>are any physical, chemical, biological or radiological substance in air, soil, water or sediment that has an adverse effect.
