        The Treasury Board, as Employer of the Public Service, is committed to providing policies and provisions designed
        to help employees balance their work, personal, and family responsibilities. In keeping with our goal of being a
        workplace of choice, this policy will assist in meeting both business and sustainable development objectives while
        satisfying the growing needs of employees to improve their overall quality of life.
      </p><p>
        Changes are occurring in the Public Service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers, as well as
        changes to traditional family structures, employees' expectations of work, and the definition of career aspirations
        and job satisfaction.
      </p><p>
        Flexibility in the workplace to accommodate work, personal and family needs can result in benefits to organizations
        such as:
      </p><ul><li>
          a competitive edge for attracting and retaining highly skilled
          individuals;
        </li><li>reduced levels of employee stress and conflict;</li><li>higher levels of productivity and reduced absenteeism;</li><li>higher levels of employee satisfaction and motivation;</li><li>a more satisfying work environment;</li><li>
          ability to accommodate employment related needs for employment equity
          designated group members.
        </li></ul><p>
        The impact of flexible work arrangements can also reach beyond the benefits derived by the organization and
        contribute to the development of a sustainable society. For example, opportunities for reducing traffic congestion and
        air pollution and for supporting regional economic development can be realized at the same time the employer's
        objectives are met.
      </p><p>
        Both managers and employees are responsible to ensure that operational needs of the organization are met and that
        neither productivity nor costs are negatively impacted by the application of this policy.
      </p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Policy objective"><p>
        To allow employees to work at alternative locations, thereby achieving a better balance between their work and
        personal lives, while continuing to contribute to the attainment of organizational goals.
      </p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="Policy statement"><p>
        The employer recognizes the opportunities that a flexible working arrangement such as the telework option can
        present, and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements where it is economically and operationally
        feasible to do so, and in a fair, equitable and transparent manner.
      </p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="Application"><p>
        This policy applies to the departments and agencies listed under Schedule 1, Part 1 of the Public Service
        Staff Relations Act.

        their work duties from a telework place

      </p><p>Participation in telework is voluntary, that is no employee shall be required to telework</p><p>
        Prior to approving requests from employees to telework, whether for some or all of the regular workweek, managers
        shall ensure that the following conditions apply:
      </p><ul><li>
          the nature of the work to be performed at the teleworkplace is

          the responsibility for normal maintenance and repair;
        </li><li>
          if, the employee requests to telework using his/her own equipment,
          then he/she is responsible for the maintenance and repair unless otherwise agreed to by the employer.
        </li></ul><p>Employees who participate in telework are responsible for:</p><ul><li>
          the costs of maintaining the teleworkplace (such as insurance, heat,
          and hydro);

        Employees shall be encouraged to share the details of the arrangement with their bargaining agent.
      </p></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="Accountability and Monitoring"><p>
        In order to create and sustain a work environment that promotes and encourages work-life balance there is a
        requirement for deputy heads to implement effective and efficient human resource practices such as accommodating
        telework requests, where it is economical and operationally feasible to do so. Departments must periodically evaluate
        the implementation of this policy to ensure it contributes to the well-being of their organizations and be able to
        demonstrate that teleworking arrangements comply with the conditions outlined in this policy. Treasury Board may
        undertake to monitor the effectiveness of this policy by measuring its use, benefits to organizations and adherence to
        the policy requirements.
