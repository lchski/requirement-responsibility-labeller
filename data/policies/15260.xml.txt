Purpose"><p>This Treasury Board Information and Technology Standard (TBITS-38) is not intended as
  government standard for government employee ID cards. Rather, it is a standard for
  government employee technology cards. Departments are free to design their own ID cards
  and these designs differ in accordance with each department's particular needs. This
  design for the employee technology card was based on a sample of departmental ID cards so
  that, should any department choose to combine its employee technology card with its ID
  card, the result would be similar to the design in this TBITS.</p><p>This standard adopts the physical parameters specified in the ISO/IEC standards listed
  in paragraph 1.7 for use by the Government of Canada as its specifications for a
  government employee technology card that includes any combination of the three
  technologies: integrated circuit (chip), magnetic stripe and/or bar code. As such, the
  standards in paragraph 1.7 are to be considered an integral part of this standard.
  Compliance with these standards is required to achieve the following benefits: </p><ul><li>the portability of technology cards among different vendors' equipment and among
    departments and agencies; </li><li>the development of common applications shared by all departments and agencies; and </li><li>a reduction in the number of cards a government employee is required to possess.</li></ul><p>This standard also adopts the design in Appendix A for the visual information printed
  on the government employee technology card including the location of this information on
  the front and back of the card. Departments and agencies are encouraged to follow this
  standard for their employee technology cards in order to promote common recognition of
  these cards and to permit their portability between departments and agencies, for example,
  when employees are transferred, seconded or require temporary access to another department
  or agency.</p><p>Departments and agencies contemplating the use of other technologies for their employee
  technology cards, e.g., optical media, are encouraged to contact the TBITS Advanced Card
  Technology working group to ensure that government-wide implications are considered.
  Departments and agencies are also encouraged to contact this working group when
  contemplating the use of any type of technology cards for the delivery of their programs
  and services (cards issued to the public) so that a common approach can be developed among
  departments and agencies with similar needs.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Application"><p>This standard applies to cards issued to government employees for internal government
  operations that require information to be accessible from any combination of the three
  technologies: integrated circuit (chip), magnetic stripe and/or bar code.</p><p>While the use of this standard is not mandatory, departments are strongly encouraged to
  adopt the first part of this standard (the physical parameters) since it is based on
  international standards widely adopted by industry and a common standard is necessary for
  interdepartmental interoperability. It is recommended that departments also adopt the
  second part of this standard for the appearance of their employee technology and minimize
  any change to the overall appearance of the card if it must be revised to meet their
  requirements.</p><p>This standard has no retroactive application and does not require the alteration or
  refitting of existing advanced technology card applications.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Qualification"><p>This standard is not intended to restrict departments and agencies to cards employing
  these three technologies; however, to ensure interdepartmental portability, departments
  are encouraged to use cards complying with this standard whenever appropriate.</p><p>When departments and agencies have operational requirements that require information on
  their employee technology cards in addition to that included in the design standard, they
  should first consider storing the information on the card electronically. Where this is
  not possible, departments and agencies should add the additional information but in a
  manner that respects the overall design as much as possible to preserve common recognition
  of these cards.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Specifications"><p>This TBITS specifies the ISO/IEC standards in Paragraph 1.7 and the design standard in
  Appendix A for use by the Government of Canada. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Implementation"><p>The effective date of this standard is May 1998.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="" title="7.
