Management of leave with pay or time off work with pay"><p>Upon application from persons appointed to the core public administration, persons with the delegated authority may approve 
          leave with pay in accordance with the relevant collective agreement or terms and conditions of employment. Time off work 
        may be granted in accordance with the provisions set out in this Appendix.</p><p>1.1 Persons with the delegated authority who approve leave or grant time off work with pay have the right to schedule 
          such absences in a manner that takes into account operational requirements. All absences from work must be authorized by 
        the person with the delegated authority to approve the specific absence.</p></section><section anchor="A.2" title="2. Management of specific leave with pay or time off work with pay situations"><p>2.1 This Appendix establishes criteria that are to be followed when the employer allows for paid leave or paid time off 
          work when such absences are occasioned by legal or societal obligations or are deemed by the employer to be situations when 
        persons appointed to the core public administration should not suffer loss of income. The criteria are as follows:</p><p>2.2 Paid time off work</p><p>2.2.1 Time off for voting </p><p>All persons appointed to the core public administration, including casual workers and terms less than three months, must 
          be given time off with pay to vote (including proxy voting) in federal, provincial<em>, </em>territorial and municipal elections, 
        referenda or plebiscites. The requirements are as follows: </p><p><strong>Federal elections, referenda or plebiscites</strong></p><ul><li>Three consecutive hours during the period the polls are open.</li></ul><p><strong>Provincial or territorial elections, referenda or plebiscites</strong></p><ul><li>The number of consecutive hours specified in the legislation of the province or territory in which the person resides.</li></ul><p><strong>Municipal elections, referenda or plebiscites </strong></p><ul><li>The number of consecutive hours specified in the statutes governing municipal elections, referenda or plebiscites 
            of the province or territory in which the municipality is located; when there is no such provision, the time is that established 
          for elections in the province or territory in which the person resides.</li></ul><p>2.2.2 Time off due to adverse climatic or environmental conditions</p><p>Persons with the delegated authority exercise their discretionary power to grant time off with pay only if satisfied 
        that the adverse climatic or environmental conditions affect a person's capability to remain on or report for duty. </p><p>Adverse environmental conditions at the work place, such as a lack of heat, and emergency conditions affecting the community, 
          such as a serious flood or snowstorm, are examples of conditions that could warrant management to exercise discretion with 
        respect to granting time off with pay. </p><p>2.2.3 Time off for personal medical and dental appointments </p><p>In the core public administration, it is the practice for the employer to grant paid time off, for up to half a day, 
          for persons to attend their own personal medical and dental appointments without charge to their leave credits in cases 
          of routine, periodic check-ups. When a series of continuing medical or dental appointments are necessary for treatment of 
          a particular condition, persons with the delegated authority ensure that absences are to be charged to the person's sick 
        leave credits. </p><p>2.3 Leave with pay </p><p>2.3.1 Religious observance </p><p>Persons with the delegated authority to approve leave should examine, on an individual basis, each request for leave 
          to meet religious obligations. When approving leave for reasons of religious observance, persons with the delegated authority 
          ensure, whenever operationally feasible, that appropriate arrangements are made for make-up time, such as the use of vacation 
          or compensatory leave, shift exchanges in the case of shift workers, variable hours of work or individual arrangements to 
        make up time. </p><p>2.3.2 Recreational, personal and other special reasons</p><p>When granting leave for participating in departmental social activities or similar purposes, persons with the delegated 
          authority ensure that leave is to be charged against a person's vacation leave credits. In the event of a relatively brief 
          leave period, such as extended lunch hours, hours of work may be scheduled to maintain the normal overall weekly hours of 
        work. </p><p>2.3.3 Participation in international sporting events</p><p>A person appointed to the core public administration may be granted by the person with the delegated authority leave 
          with pay for other reasons for the purpose of training for or participating in international sporting events. The leave 
          period must not exceed three calendar months per year, if it is taken in one period, or 66 working days per year if it is 
          taken in broken periods (these amounts include any earned but unused vacation leave credits to which the person is entitled). 
          Training or participation by a person includes involvement as an athlete, an official referee, a judge, a coach or other 
        official.</p><p>Leave with pay for other reasons may be granted by the person with the delegated authority under the following conditions:
        </p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>there must be a recommendation, on behalf of the person, from a national sport-government body and the recommendation 
          for participation must be validated by the appropriate government sport organization, such as Sport Canada; and</li><li>the person's unused vacation leave credits must be liquidated before the additional sporting event leave for other 
          reasons is granted.</li></ol><p>2.3.4 Serve in the Canadian Forces Reserve</p><p>Persons appointed to the core public administration may be granted leave with pay for other reasons for the purpose of 
          serving in the Canadian Forces Reserve. Persons with the delegated authority to approve such leave are encouraged to grant 
          leave of absences for this purpose. Such leave is to conform to the provisions of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.3/index.html">Reserve Forces Training Leave Regulations</a></em> 
        made pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-5/index.html">National Defence Act</a>. </em></p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B—Leave Without Pay"><section anchor="B.1" title="1. Management of leave without pay"><p>1.1 Upon application from persons appointed to the core public administration, persons with the delegated authority may 
        approve leave without pay in accordance with the relevant collective agreement or terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>1.2 Persons with the delegated authority are to ensure that persons appointed to the core public administration who apply 
          for leave without pay for other reasons not covered under the relevant collective agreement or terms and conditions of employment 
          clearly identify, in their application, the reason for the absence, such as to accept employment in the office of a minister, 
        a minister of State, a secretary of State, or member of Parliament or to participate in political activity. </p><p><strong>Note: </strong></p><p>Heads of human resources must ensure that systems or procedures are in place to track the reason for leave without pay, 
          particularly in cases involving political activity as defined in Part 7 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/index.html">Public Service Employment Act</a></em> in 
        order to provide the Public Service Commission with data for monitoring purposes. </p><p>1.3 Compensation advisors are to inform persons who have been granted leave without pay of the implications that such 
          leave will have on their pay and benefits, such as various insurance plans, leave entitlements, severance pay entitlements 
        and contributions under the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-36/index.html">Public Service Superannuation Act</a></em> as well as all entitlements and voluntary deductions.</p><p>1.4 With the exception of persons on leave without pay to serve in the Canadian Forces Reserve, identified in Section 
          2.5. in this Appendix, a person appointed to the core public administration on leave without pay can only be replaced on 
          an indeterminate basis if the period of leave or consecutive periods of the same type of leave exceeds one year. Periods 
          of different types of leave cannot be combined for the calculation of the one year period. If the person is replaced, the 
          person with the delegated authority is to make every effort to provide suitable employment for the person following the 
        leave of absence. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>When a person on a leave of absence has been replaced on an indeterminate basis and the person with the delegated authority 
          is unable to provide suitable employment following the leave of absence, the departmental human resources advisor is to 
          be consulted, by the person with the delegated authority regarding leave of absence priorities pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/index.html">Public 
        Service Employment Act</a>.</em></p><p>When a person ceases to be an employee pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/index.html">Public Service Employment Act</a>, </em>there is no entitlement 
          to severance pay. If, however, persons resign or retire before the date on which their employment would have been terminated, 
          they may be eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with the provisions of the relevant collective agreement.
        </p></section><section anchor="B.2" title="2. Management of Specific Leave without Pay Situations"><p>2.1 This Appendix establishes criteria that are to be followed by departments in the following leave without pay situations:</p><ul><li>illness; </li><li>injury in the workplace;</li><li>to accept employment in the office of a minister, a minister of State, a secretary of State; or a member of Parliament;</li><li>to seek nomination as or be a candidate in a federal, provincial, territorial or municipal election as stipulated 
          under Part 7 of the <em>Public Service Employment Act;</em></li><li>to serve in the Canadian Forces Reserves.</li></ul><p>2.2 Illness or injury in the workplace</p><p>When a person appointed to the core public administration is unable to work due to illness or injury in the workplace 
          and has exhausted his or her sick leave credits or injury-on-duty leave, the person with the delegated authority is to consider 
        granting leave without pay. </p><p>For administrative and benefits purposes only, this type of leave without pay is referred to as sick leave without pay 
        and is recorded as such. </p><p>If it is clear that a person will not be able to return to work within the foreseeable future, the person with the delegated 
          authority is to consider granting such leave without pay for a period sufficient to enable the person to make the necessary 
        personal adjustments and preparations for separation from the core public administration on medical grounds. </p><p>When a person with the delegated authority is satisfied that there is a good chance a person will be able to return to 
          work within a reasonable period of time (the length of which will vary according to the circumstances of the case), leave 
          without pay provides an option to bridge the employment gap. The period of leave without pay is to be flexible enough to 
          allow person with the delegated authority to accommodate the needs of a person with special recovery problems, including 
        retraining.</p><p>Persons with the delegated authority are to regularly re-examine all cases of leave without pay due to illness or injury 
          in the workplace to ensure that continuation of leave without pay is warranted by current medical evidence. Such leave without 
          pay situations are to be resolved within two years of the leave commencement date, although each case must be evaluated 
        on the basis of its particular circumstances.</p><p>All leave without pay due to illness or injury in the workplace will be terminated by the person's:</p><ul><li>return to work;</li><li>resignation or retirement on medical grounds;</li><li>cessation of employment pursuant to section 42 of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/index.html">Public Service Employment Act</a>; </em>or</li><li>termination for reasons other than breaches of discipline pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act</a>.</em></li></ul><p>2.2.1 Disabled persons—return to work</p><p>Persons with the delegated authority are to consult their departmental human resources advisors when persons have been 
          certified by a competent authority as ready to return to work but are no longer able to carry out the duties of their position. 
          Human resources advisors will provide direction with respect to disabled employee priority entitlements pursuant to the
        <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-334/FullText.html">Public Service Employment Regulations</a>.</em></p><p>2.3 Acceptance of employment in the office of a minister, a minister of State, a secretary of State, or a member of Parliament</p><p>Upon request from a person appointed to the core public administration for leave without pay to accept employment in 
          the office of a minister, a minister of State, a secretary of State, or a member of Parliament, the person with the delegated 
          authority may grant leave without pay for other reasons for this purpose with the understanding that all the requirements 
        with respect to leave without pay established in this Appendix are applicable. </p><p>2.3.1 Political activity</p><p>Persons appointed to the core public administration are to consult their departmental human resources advisors to seek 
          direction regarding the provisions related to political activity in the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/index.html">Public Service Employment Act</a></em> as well as 
        the role of the Public Service Commission. </p><p>2.4 Seek nomination as or be a candidate in a federal, provincial, territorial or municipal election</p><p>Upon request from a person appointed to the core public administration for leave without pay for other reasons when the 
          reason is to seek nomination as a candidate or to be a candidate in a federal, provincial, territorial or municipal election, 
          the person with the delegated authority is to forward the request to the departmental human resources senior official, who 
        is to forward the leave request to the Public Service Commission: </p><p>If the Public Service Commission grants permission to seek nomination as a candidate or to be a candidate in a federal<em>,</em> 
          provincial, territorial or municipal election, the person appointed to the core public administration may proceed on leave 
          without pay for other reasons. As such, all the requirements with respect to leave without pay established in this Appendix 
          are applicable. The period of leave without pay ends on the day on which the results of the election are officially declared, 
        or on an earlier day, as requested by the person if she or he has ceased to be a candidate. </p><p>When a person appointed to the core public administration is declared elected as a member of the House of Commons, the 
          legislature of a province, the Council of the Yukon Territory, the Council of the Northwest Territories or the Legislative 
          Assembly of Nunavut, the person ceases to be an employee pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-33.01/index.html">Public Service Employment Act</a>, </em>and there 
          is no entitlement to severance pay for this type of cessation of employment. If, however, the person resigns or retires 
          before the date on which their employment would have been terminated for this reason, the person may be eligible to receive 
        severance pay in accordance with the provisions of the relevant collective agreement and terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>2.5 Serve in the Canadian Forces Reserve</p><p>Persons appointed to the core public administration who request leave to serve in Reserve Forces activities, as described 
        in subsection 247.5(1) the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-2/index.html">Canada Labour Code</a></em> as: </p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>an operation in Canada or abroad – including preparation, training, rest or travel or to the employee's residence

          basis, even if the absence is for a period exceeding one year. Such leave is to conform to the provisions of the <em>Reserve  Forces Training Leave Regulations</em> made pursuant to the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-5/index.html">National Defence Act</a>.</em></p><p>Persons on leave without pay for this purpose may only be replaced on a term basis and are to be reinstated in the position 
          that they occupied on the day before the day on which the leave began. If the person with the delegated authority is not 
        able to reinstate the person in that position by reason of a workforce adjustment, the workforce adjustment measures apply.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C—Pre-Retirement Transition Leave: A Special Working Arrangement"><section anchor="C.1" title="1. Special working arrangement"><p>Pre-retirement transition leave is a special working arrangement whereby eligible persons who are within two years of 
          retirement have their workweek reduced by up to 40 per cent. For a full-time person, this represents up to two out of five 
        working days. </p><p>Pay for the participating person would be adjusted to reflect the shorter workweek, but their pension and benefits coverage, 
          as well as premiums and contributions, would continue at the pre-arrangement levels. The person would continue to be subject 
          to the provisions of the relevant collective agreement or terms and conditions of employment and their employment status 
        (full-time or part-time) would remain unchanged during the working arrangement. </p></section><section anchor="C.2" title="2.

              at least 2 years of pensionable service at the time of retirement) and agree to resign effective at the end of the leave

Effect of the special working arrangement on pay and benefits"><h4>5.1 Annual rate of pay</h4><p>The annual rate of pay will be reduced to reflect the number of non-work days during the working arrangement. </p><p>Throughout this section the expression <em>unreduced rate of pay refers</em> to the annual rate of pay in effect before 
          the commencement of the working arrangement. The term <em>reduced rate of pay</em> refers to the annual rate of pay in effect

          plan). Compensation advisors will provide persons appointed to the core public administration with information regarding 
        this exception.</p><h4>5.6 Supplementary Death Benefit</h4><p>The premium for Supplementary Death Benefit will be deducted based on the unreduced rate of pay because the benefits 
        are payable based on the unreduced rate of pay<em>. </em></p><h4>5.7 Disability or long-term disability insurances</h4><p>The premium for these insurance plans will be deducted based on the unreduced rate of pay because the coverage is based

        agreement or terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>Earned vacation and sick leave credits may be used on the at-work days only. Vacation and sick leave may not be granted 
        for the non-work (leave without pay) days. </p><h4>5.14 Designated paid holidays</h4><p>Full-time persons participating in the pre-retirement transition leave working arrangement are entitled to designated 
          paid holidays in accordance with the relevant collective agreement or terms and conditions of employment if they are not 
          on leave without pay on both the working day preceding the designated holiday <strong>and </strong>on the working day following
