Effective date"><p>1.1 This standard takes effect on January 31, 2013.</p><p>1.2 Government institutions using Web analytics externally on servers hosted by third parties must comply with the requirements 
of <a href="#appA">Appendix A</a> of this standard as of January 31, 2013, with the exception of those requirements in section 3 of Appendix 
A, which must be complied with no later than June 30, 2014.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 This standard applies to the government institutions defined in 
<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-1.html#h-3">section 3 of the <em>Privacy Act</em></a>, including parent Crown 
corporations and any wholly owned subsidiary of these corporations.</p><p>2.2 This standard does not apply to the Bank of Canada.</p><p>2.3 This standard applies to the collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal of personal information for the 
purpose of carrying out Web analytics on external public-facing Government of Canada websites in a manner consistent with 
the provisions in Appendix A of this standard.</p><p>2.4 This standard applies regardless of which tracking technologies or services are being used for purposes of Web analytics.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 Web analytics can be described as the collection, analysis, measurement and reporting of data about Web traffic and 
user visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage.</p><p>3.2 Many government institutions are using Web analytics to obtain information about visitors to their websites for two 
main purposes: (i) to better meet the needs of website visitors; and (ii) to assist in delivering effective online services.</p><p>3.3 Web analytics tools operate through the collection of information to record a visitor's online interactions with one 
or more Web pages. That information includes, as an example, the Internet Protocol address assigned by an Internet service 
provider to the visitor's computer.</p><p>3.4 The <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html">Privacy Act</a></em> defines the term "personal information" as meaning "information about an identifiable individual 
recorded in any form." If information collected for Web analytics can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, 
either alone or when combined with other identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, then 
that information will be personal information that must be safeguarded in accordance with the requirements of the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p><p>3.5 The Internet Protocol address may, in some circumstances, be linked with an identifiable individual whose computer 
is using that address at any given time. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers the Internet Protocol address 
to be personal information that must, in all cases, be dealt with in accordance with the requirements of the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p><p>3.6 Specific requirements for safeguarding the Internet Protocol address, and any other personal information collected 
by government institutions in relation to Web analytics, are set out in Appendix A of this standard.</p><p>3.7 If government institutions wish to use Web analytics tools on institutional servers or on servers hosted by third 
parties, they must do so in accordance with the requirements of this standard and any other applicable policy instruments 
and legislation.</p><p>3.8 Government institutions must include a Privacy Notice on their websites that meets the requirements described in 
<a href="#appB">Appendix B</a> of this standard. Such Privacy Notices must also meet the requirements in 
<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18309&amp;section=text#sec6.2">sections 6.2.9 and 6.2.10 of the <em>Directive 
on Privacy Practices</em></a> and also the relevant <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24227&amp;section=text#appC">Terms and Conditions for Privacy Notices in Appendix C of the
