and Government Services Canada effective September 1, 2006. Program policy will continue to be the responsibility of the Treasury Board Secretariat.</p><p>This transfer is consistent with the mandate of PWGSC to negotiate and administer agreements for banking services with financial institutions on behalf 
of the Receiver General for Canada.</p><p>Day-to-day operation of the acquisition cards program will not change. Therefore, you should continue to deal with the card-issuing companies for card 
issuance, cancellation, and invoicing. However, after August 31, 2006, you should direct your questions to PWGSC, including all requests to pilot new 
services or expand the current program. Requests related to policy interpretation and the type of purchases that may be made with the acquisition card 
should continue to be directed to the appropriate Treasury Board representative.</p><p>Over the coming months, PWGSC and TBS will be updating documentation related to the acquisition card program and will be communicating these updates 
to Departmental Card Coordinators.</p><p>Should you require additional information regarding the details of this transfer, please do not hesitate to contact Richard Inomata of TBS at 613-946-4221,
