Departments shall adapt residential units to the technical standard when employees or their immediate dependants require accessibility.</p><h3>Exemptions and minor variations</h3><p>5.5. Certain elements of real property may be exempted from the full accessibility requirements unless the intended use requires public access or the job requirements are such that a person with a disability could meet these requirements. Custodians shall establish internal procedures for identifying and seeking the deputy head's approval of full or partial exemptions from the accessibility requirements of this standard. They shall document the rationale for these exemptions and maintain records 
of all real property that is partially or fully exempted in accordance with this standard.</p><p>5.6. If the criteria that justified the exemption change, the custodian shall reassess the real property against this standard to ensure that the exemption is still justified.</p><p>5.7. Custodians may allow minor variations from the accessibility requirements of this standard (including the technical standard). However, such variations shall be consistent with the general intent of this standard and shall not affect the general accessibility of a specific property.</p><p>5.8.

In deviating from the standard, custodians shall ensure that the following requirements are met:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>access shall be provided to at least one main level of the building;</li><li>there shall be full access to government services and employment opportunities;</li><li>where washroom facilities are provided in an inaccessible location, equivalent facilities that are accessible shall also be provided; and</li><li>for inaccessible exhibitions, another version of the exhibition, such as a video display, shall be provided in an accessible area.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6.
