Effective date"><p>1.1 This directive takes effect on May 5, 2016.</p><p>1.2 It replaces the Directive on the Administration of the Access to Information Act dated May 5, 2014.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 This directive applies to  government institutions as defined in <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/page-1.html#h-3">section  3 of the Access to  Information Act</a>  (Act), including parent Crown corporations and their wholly‑owned  subsidiaries, if any.</p><p>2.2 This directive, with the exception  of clause 7.13, is issued pursuant to <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/page-11.html#h-30">paragraph 70(1)(c) of the Act</a>. Clause 7.13 is issued pursuant to <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/page-1.html#h-7">subsection  5(2) of the Act</a>.</p><p>2.3 This directive does not apply to  the Bank of Canada.</p><p>2.4 This directive does not apply to information that is excluded under the Act.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1 The core principle of the Access to Information Act is that government information should be available to the public, subject only to limited and specific exceptions to protect privacy, confidentiality and security. By providing access to government information, the Act serves the important public interest of enabling public debate on the conduct of government institutions, strengthening the accountability of government to its citizens. The Act should be administered with these core principles in mind.</p><p>3.2 The Act gives Canadian citizens, permanent residents within the  meaning of <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/page-1.html#h-2">subsection  2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee  Protection Act</a> and any individual or corporation  present in Canada the right of access to records under the control of a  government institution, subject only to limited and specific exceptions. The Act further provides that decisions  on the non-disclosure of information can be reviewed independently of  government.</p><p>3.3 The Act also specifies that it is intended to complement existing  procedures for obtaining government information and is not to limit in any way  the type of information that is normally available to the public, thereby  denoting the importance of informal access.</p><p>3.4 The administration of the Act is the responsibility of the  heads of government institutions. Heads (or their delegates) process requests  for access to information in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-83-507/">Access  to Information Regulations</a> (Regulations), which  include the duty to assist applicants. The Act and the Regulations  also spell out parameters relating to the transfer of access requests, the  extension of time limits, the charging of fees, the grounds for exemptions and  exclusions, the process for giving notice to third parties, and the language,  format and method of access. This directive is intended to support heads (and  their delegates) in the administration of the Act by providing specific direction for responding to requests  under the Act and by  establishing principles for assisting applicants.</p><p>3.5 This directive is to be read in  conjunction with the Act, the Regulations and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12453">Policy on Access to Information</a>. Where  there is ambiguity, the Act takes  precedence over this directive.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4.

consistency among government  institutions, the Information and Privacy Policy Division of the Treasury Board  of Canada Secretariat has developed, in consultation with the access to  information and privacy community, criteria for posting the summaries of  completed access to information (ATI) requests on the Government of Canada’s  mandated website.</p><section anchor="E.1" title="Mandatory Criteria"><p>Institutions must meet the following criteria in relation to the posting of summaries:</p><ol><li>Post summaries of completed Access to  Information requests within 30 calendar days after the end of each month. When  no ATI requests are completed in a given month, an update to this effect must  still be made. Monthly updates assure website visitors that the information is  current.</li><li>
						The entry for each summary must include  the following:
						
						<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The<strong> request number</strong> assigned by the institution;</li><li>A<strong> summary </strong>of the request that reflects the final text of the request after  clarification was obtained from the applicant, where applicable. Summaries must  not include personal information or any other information that would be  exempted or excluded under the Act,  or that could reveal a requester’s identity; </li><li>The<strong> disposition</strong> of the request (i.e., all disclosed; disclosed in part; all  exempted; all excluded; or no records exist). Requests that were transferred,  abandoned or treated informally are not to be included; and</li><li>The<strong> number of pages</strong> released.</li></ol></li><li>Provide the summaries simultaneously in both official languages with translations that must be accurate to meet the requirements of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/">Official Languages Act</a>;</li><li>Do not include summaries of requests  that are uniquely of interest to the applicant, that contain primarily personal  information of the applicant (e.g., Citizenship and Immigration Canada  immigration case files), or requests that could reveal a requester’s identity. </li></ol></section></appendix></appendices></doc>
