Standard endorses the use of a Business Number (BN) to uniquely identify private 
and public sector entities (i.e. registrants), government programs, and operating 
entity(ies).</p><p>2.2 To support BN implementation, this standard designates Revenue Canada as 
the Issuing Organization and describes the procedures and identifying information 
which is required to support <acronym title="Business Number">BN</acronym> assignment 
and service delivery.</p><p>2.3 This standard requires that the BN be used in applicable transactions and 
provides opportunities to reduce costs while streamlining and expediting government 
services.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Application"><p>3.1 This standard applies to all transactions, between private and public sector 
entities, as prescribed by policy or regulations issued persuant to applicable legislation, 
and Government of Canada organizations defined as departments in Schedules 1 &amp; 2 
of the <em><strong>Financial Administration Act</strong></em>.</p><p>3.2 A BN must be used in all transactions with the Government of Canada that 
are undertaken to meet the obligations associated with the programs identified in 
section 5.3 below.</p><p>3.3 This standard applies to all the systems which create and transmit transactions 
related to the programs identified in section 5.3 below.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Specification"><p>4.1 The BN includes a nine digit registration number and a six character account 
identifier as specified in Appendix A. The account identifier uses two letters to 
uniquely identify a program and four digits to uniquely identify an operating entity(ies) 

for that program.</p><p>4.2 Appendix B defines the registrant identifying information that is needed 
to support registration and communications between the Government of Canada and 
the registrant or its operating entity(ies).</p><p>4.3 To acquire a BN, all applicants must follow assignment and maintenance procedures 
established by the Issuing Organization or Issuing Agent.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Qualifications"><p>5.1 Further information on applicable private and public sector entities, legal 
obligations and reporting criteria is given in documents provided by the Issuing 
Organization or Issuing Agent for each program.</p><p>5.2 Information used to identify a registrant must be accurate and current to 
ensure timely service delivery. All BN registrants must notify the Issuing Organization 
or applicable Issuing Agent of changes in the registrant's identifying information 
or program participation. (See Appendix A for BN maintenance and Appendix B for 
identifying information).</p><p>5.3 The initial implementation of this standard is limited to the following programs: 
Goods and Services Tax (GST); import/export; corporate income tax, and; payroll 
source deductions. Other programs will be added as requirements evolve and resources 
permit. Appendix A.1.2.1 identifies candidate programs for addition to this list 
in accordance with an implementation strategy being developed by the Issuing Organization 
for the propagation of the BN to other transactions.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Implementation"><p>6.1 Commencing January 1995, a phased in implementation will occur. All existing 
registrants who have an "old style" account number will be invited to convert to 
the BN. Beginning January 1, 1997, the BN will be mandatory for all transactions 
covered by the four programs specified in section 5.3.</p><p>6.2 All systems under development or modification, as of the date of adoption 
of this standard, must be capable of providing the BN in transactions with the Government 
of Canada.</p><p>6.3 All information technology plans prepared after the date of adoption of this 
standard must reflect a suitable BN migration and/or implementation strategy.</p><p>6.4 The Issuing Organization has the exclusive responsibility for all facets 
of BN assignment, promotion, administration, dissemination, extension to new programs 
and safeguarding the integrity of the BN information, including the registration, 
promulgation and maintenance of program identifiers that have been assigned.</p><p>6.5 The Issuing Organization may designate other organizations as Issuing Agents 
to assist it in discharging the responsibilities under 6.4</p></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7.

or more operating entities that deal with the Government of Canada on the registrant's 
behalf. Figure A.1 illustrates the two parts (i.e. registration number and account 
identifier) which make up the BN and what these parts identify.</p><p>Figure A.1 - BN and its components -- Not available</p><h4>A.1.1 Registration number</h4><p>A registration number consists of a 9 digit number that uniquely identifies a 
private sector entity (e.g. sole proprietor, corporation, partnership, trust, etc.) 
or a public sector entity (e.g. charity, non-profit organization, educational institution, 
government department, municipality, etc.). Public and private sector entities, 
which are required to use the BN in program specific dealings with the Government 
of Canada, are defined by government statutes and regulations which created the 
applicable government programs.</p><p>The same registration number shall be used to identify a registrant for every 
designated Government of Canada program (i.e. accounts identified by one of the 
program identifiers given in A.1.2 or as updated by subsequent amendments).</p><h4>A.1.2 Account Identifier</h4><p><strong>A.1.2.1 Program Identifier</strong></p><p>To facilitate user consultation the BN is displayed as three components, separated 
by a space, as shown below:</p><p>Figure A.2 B Formatted Display of BN -- Not available</p><p>A program identifier consists of a 2 character alphabetic code which uniquely 
identifies a government program. The following two letter <em>codes</em> have been 
assigned to identify the initial four programs under the BN initiative:</p><ul class="noBullet"><li>RC B corporate income tax</li><li>RM B import/export duties</li><li>RP B payroll source deductions</li><li>RT B goods and services tax</li></ul><p>Program identifiers which have been earmarked for near term activation include 
the following:</p><ul class="noBullet"><li>VS B vendor/supplier of goods and services to government</li><li>VC B consignee (government destination/accounting point)</li></ul><p><strong>A.1.2.2 Reference Number</strong></p><p>A reference number is a 4 digit number that uniquely identifies one operating 
entity, designated by the registrant, to undertake program-specific dealings with 
the Government on the registrant's behalf. A registrant may choose to designate 
separate or numerous operating entities for each program. Each such operating entity 
will be identified by a reference number that is program-specific. </p></section><section anchor="A.2" title="A.2 BN Assignment"><h4>A.2.1 Registration Number Assignment</h4><p>The Issuing Organization is the only agency that may assign a registration number 
to a registrant.</p><p>To ensure that every registrant is provided with one number only, the request 
for a registration number must include the registrant's name, address and related 
information (defined in Appendix B) that describes the registrant accurately and 
sufficiently. The name of a designated officer or contact person may also be included 
to facilitate communications between the registrant and the Issuing Organization.</p><p>Figure A.3 shows the identifying information that is associated with its corresponding 
registration number. This information is required to support BN assignment and database 
RM maintenance.</p><p>Figure A.3 B Relationship between Registration Number and Registrant Identifying 
Information -- Not available</p><h4>A.2.2 Program Identifer Assignment</h4><p>Public and private sector bodies must not define and extend the program identifier 
values. Any departmentally devised program identifiers are a separate data type 
and must remain distinct from any values associated with the BN. Unassigned BN program 
identifier values are reserved for exclusive administration by the BN Issuing Organization.</p><h4>A.2.3 Reference Number Assignment</h4><p>As required by the registrant, one or more operating entities may be the contact 
point for specific programs. Each operating entity will be identified by a reference 
number that is associated with a specific program identifier. A business or a mailing 
address, specified by the registrant, is used to distinguish among operating entities 
with identical names. </p><p>Reference numbers will be assigned sequentially beginning with 0001. The Issuing 
Organization or Issuing Agent will keep track of the next unassigned number for 
each program for each registrant. The default value will be 0001.</p><p>As illustrated in Figure A.4 below, a reference number has no inherent significance. 
For example, reference number 0001 for an operating entity in the RT program can 
not be assumed to represent the same operating entity as reference number 0001 in 
the RM program.</p><p>Figure A.4 B Relationship between Registrant, Program Identifiers, Operating 
Entities and Reference Numbers -- Not available</p><p>Note: This approach was adopted in response to registrant community requests 
for flexibility and to avoid costly tracking of reference numbers across program 
identifiers as registrants shift delegated responsibilities to different operating 
entities to satisfy changing service needs.</p></section><section anchor="A.3" title="A.3 BN Maintenance"><p>The Issuing Organization and Issuing Agent(s) will define procedures to ensure 
that public and private sector entities which have obtained a BN and their operating 
entities which have an associated reference number will notify the Issuing Organization 
or the designated Issuing Agent of address and other identification information 
changes or termination of operations as soon as such changes occur.</p><p>If a private or public sector entity changes its legal status (i.e. becomes a 
new legal entity), it must obtain a new BN.</p><p>A registration number will not be reassigned to another registrant in the event 
that a current owner terminates its activities or applicable transactions with the 
federal government. The Issuing Organization or the applicable Issuing Agent must 
be notified of such terminations or change of status.</p><p>Only certain programs qualify for BN registration. Additional program identifiers 
will be defined by the Issuing Organization through consultation with private and 
public sector entities taking into consideration: realistic implementation timeframes; 
legislative requirements; business rules; costs and benefits to registration agencies 
and registrants alike.</p></section></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B - Registrant Identifying Information"><p>This appendix is normative.</p><section anchor="B.1" title="B.1 Transaction and registration needs"><p>A BN registrant, its operating entities, and/or their representatives must be 
precisely and adequately identified so that every transaction may be correctly addressed 
to its intended recipient. The registrants must also be properly identified to support 
BN registration.</p></section><section anchor="B" title="B.2 Required and Shareable Identifying Information"><p>Table B.1 illustrates the information that is needed to identify a registrant 
or to address a party in a transaction. Columns 1, 2 and 5 specify the identifying 
information which will be requested or generated during the registration phase. 
Columns 3, 4 and 5 represent the kind of information that is required to address 
a party to a transaction.</p><p>Since name and address information is shareable, an electronic directory project 
is being planned to manage this type of information on a government-wide basis. 
Columns 3, 4 and 5 provide a representative sample of the identifying information 
that has been standardized for electronic directory services by ISO 9594 parts 6 
and 7 plus associated OSI implementers agreements. Although ISO 9594 was designed 
specifically to provide directory services, the standards bodies responsible for 
this specification recognize that this information and associated services could 
be used by other applications.</p><p>Although certain identifying information is shareable and could be shared, TBITS-30 
gives no specifications concerning the data, the format, nor the interchange mechanisms 
for shareable data. Column 4 illustrates the registration data that could be shared 
if consensus is reached to use ISO 9594 as an exchange and maintenance mechanism. 
If this data is shared, its contents will comply with conventions defined in column 
2 and summarized in Appendix C instead of the corresponding constraints specified 
in ISO 9594-6 (i.e. columns 4 and 5).</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="widthFull"><tr><th scope="col" class="alignTop">Identifying Information</th><th scope="col" class="alignTop">Issuing Organization Attribute Type &amp; Size</th><th scope="col" class="alignTop">Equivalent ISO 9594-6 Attribute</th><th scope="col" class="alignTop">ISO 9594-6 Attribute Type &amp; Size</th><th scope="col" class="width30 alignTop">Description /Explanation of Identifying Information
