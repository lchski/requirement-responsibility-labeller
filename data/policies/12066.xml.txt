Departments must make these donations directly, i.e., not through PWGSC.</p><p><strong>4.8</strong> When selling surplus materiel assets in Canada, departments must:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>use remarketing standing offers or other contractual arrangements whenever these have put in place by PWGSC;</li><li>for direct sales conducted under departmental authorities (granted either by legislation or by the Treasury Board), ensure that as broad and as transparent an opportunity as possible is made available to Canadians to purchase surplus assets; and</li><li>otherwise (unless a disposal site is too remote for PWGSC to effectively manage the sale) use the disposal services of the Crown Assets Distribution Directorate or one of the Crown Assets Distribution Centres operated by PWGSC in Canada.</li></ol><p><strong>4.9</strong> When selling surplus materiel assets at sites in Canada too remote for PWGSC to effectively manage sales and at sites outside Canada, departments are authorized to sell their surplus materiel assets directly.</p><p><strong>4.10</strong> When spending the proceeds of disposal, departments must:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>ensure that, to the maximum possible extent, proceeds are spent in the fiscal year in which they are recorded. Should proceeds be recorded too late in a fiscal year to be spent in that same year, they may be carried forward to the next fiscal year, after which time any unused spending authority will lapse; and</li><li>ensure that proceeds are used only for disposal, operating and capital expenditures and are not used for transfer payments.</li></ol><p><strong>4.11</strong> Departments must maintain auditable records of the costing analyses that were used to justify disposal decisions.</p><p><strong>4.12</strong> Departments must have a delegation instrument in place that clearly sets out departmental authorities and accountabilities for the disposal of surplus moveable materiel assets.</p><p><strong>4.13</strong> PWGSC must endeavour on an ongoing basis to optimize the roles of the private sector and the non-federal public sector in Canada in the disposal of surplus materiel assets.</p><p><strong>4.14</strong> When selling or putting arrangements in place to sell surplus materiel assets on behalf of departments, PWGSC must ensure that as broad and as transparent an opportunity as possible is made available to Canadians to purchase these assets.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5.
