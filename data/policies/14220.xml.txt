Payment of Retroactive Revisions"><p>4.1 Retroactive remuneration is paid in an amount equal to what would
have been paid to the executive had the revision been approved on
the effective date.</p><p>4.2 A retroactive revision in salary ranges applies to executives, former executives or in the case of death, the beneficiary or estate of former executives employed during the retroactive period.</p><p>4.3 In order for former executives, or in the case of death, for the former executive’s beneficiary or estate to receive payment in accordance with paragraph 4.2, the employer notifies by registered mail, such individuals at their last known address that they have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the registered letter to request in writing such payment, after which time any obligation upon the employer to provide payment ceases.</p><p>4.4 No payment or notification is made for one dollar ($1) or less.</p><p>4.5 Unless otherwise specified, the non-salary elements in Appendix C of this directive are recalculated as though the revision had been approved on the effective date.</p><p>4.6 When a retroactive revision is announced, the revised salary of an executive in one of the situations listed below is calculated according to either 4.6.1 or 4.6.2. The calculation that provides the higher revised salary is applied.</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Promoted, demoted, or reclassified during the retroactive period,</li><li>Commenced an acting appointment during the retroactive period, or</li><li>Commenced an acting appointment prior to the start of the retroactive period but continued the acting appointment during the retroactive period.</li></ol><div class="indent1"><p>4.6.1 Compare the higher of the revised salary under either a. or b. below to the salary calculated in 4.6.2:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Recalculate the executive’s substantive salary, (and in acting situations, also recalculate the executive’s acting salary), based on the revised executive salary maximum applicable to the position,<br /><br />

Salary on Appointment"><p>5.1 Appointment to an executive position from outside the public service</p><div class="indent1"><p>5.1.1 Persons recruited to executive positions from outside the public service can be appointed at any rate of pay within the applicable salary range of the executive position as determined by the delegated manager.</p><p>5.1.2 In exceptional circumstances, to facilitate recruitment and retention of executives from outside the public service, where a person’s previous salary exceeds the salary maximum of the executive position, the deputy head can authorize a one-time lump sum payment. This authority cannot be sub-delegated. This lump sum is payable at the beginning of the executive’s second year in the core public administration and is based on successful completion of agreed-upon commitments. The lump sum is established within the following limits:</p><ul><li>10% of the salary maximum of the position for EX-01, EX-02, EX-03, DS-7A, DS-7B,</li><li>15% of the salary maximum of the position for EX-04, EX-05, DS-8,</li><li>The amount of the lump sum is to be 
pro-rated against the number of hours worked for executives hired on a part-time basis.</li></ul><p>5.1.3 Factors such as the following are to be considered when determining the rate of pay and the percentage of the lump sum awarded on appointment:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Internal salary relativities, i.e. the relationship of the proposed salary to that of immediate manager, subordinates and peers,</li><li>Requirement to relocate (within Canada only), i.e. regional economic differences,</li><li>Any automatic revisions that would have been granted to the executive in the former position during the balance of the calendar year in which the appointment occurs,</li><li>The position of the salary in the new range so as to leave room for future in-range salary movement,</li><li>Cash compensation (salary, performance awards) received prior to joining the core public administration, and</li><li>Shortage of skills.</li></ol></div><p>5.2 Appointment to an executive position from other occupational groups within the public service. For clarification, 
this also includes persons appointed from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Forces.</p><div class="indent1"><p>5.2.1 An increase in salary of 5% of the salary maximum of the executive position is the norm. The salary on appointment is at least the salary minimum of the executive position.</p><p>5.2.2 In exceptional circumstances, the deputy head can authorize an increase in salary of up to 10% of the salary maximum of the executive position. This authority cannot be sub-delegated. If the increase causes the new salary to exceed the salary maximum, the amount above the salary maximum is paid as a one-time lump sum on appointment. The amount of the increase is determined by considering such factors as:</p><ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Internal salary relativities, i.e. the relationship of the proposed salary to that of immediate managers, subordinates and peers,</li><li>Requirement to relocate in cases of employer initiated relocation (within Canada only), i.e. regional economic differences,</li><li>Any automatic salary revisions that would have been granted to the executive in the former position during the balance of the calendar year in which the appointment occurs,</li><li>The position of the salary in the new range so as to leave room for future in-range salary movement, and</li><li>Shortage of skills.</li></ol><p>5.2.3 When a non-executive who is already receiving acting pay accepts a permanent appointment to an EX position at the same level or higher than the position for which acting pay was being received, without a significant break between the two appointments, the executive is paid at the same rate of pay that was paid for the previous acting appointment, if it is greater than the salary as calculated in 5.2.1 or 5.2.2.</p></div><p>5.3 Appointment to a higher level executive position</p><div class="indent1"><p>5.3.1 An increase in salary of 5% of the salary maximum of the higher executive position is the norm. The salary on appointment is at least the salary minimum of the higher executive position.</p><p>5.3.2 In exceptional circumstances, the deputy head can authorize an increase in salary of up to 10% of the salary maximum of the higher executive position. This authority cannot be sub-delegated.
