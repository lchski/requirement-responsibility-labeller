        <ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>a classification grievance has  been submitted;</li><li>a better understanding of the  job is required; </li><li>monitoring activities occur,  namely to confirm the appropriate application of standardized job descriptions;</li><li>the classification of a position  involves contentious issues; and </li><li>a cyclical review occurs. </li></ol></li><li>When a job validation  review is conducted, the draft job validation report is provided to the manager  and to the employee(s) who have been interviewed for comments. The comments  obtained are included in, or appended to, the report. In the absence of comments,  the report will indicate that the opportunity to comment was provided.</li><li>The final job validation  report is signed and dated by the human resources advisor and placed on the  classification file.</li><li>Noted issues including  lack of coincidence, missing duties or poorly described work are discussed with  the manager and corrective action, such as revising the job description or  applying an alternate job description, is undertaken as required.</li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>A sample of encumbered positions may be used when performing  job validation reviews where standardized job descriptions are being used.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B - Control of Vacant  Positions"><p>The abolishment of vacant positions contributes to:</p><ul><li>Maintain the integrity of the       Classification Program by ensuring that positions reflect the       organization's resource allocation;</li><li>the currency and accuracy of organizational charts and </li><li>the integrity of interdepartmental Position and Classification       Information System data, which is used for various purposes including       classification relativity studies. </li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>Organizations manage their  vacant positions through regular reviews.</li><li>The number of vacant  positions (including inactive positions) is kept to a minimum at all times.</li><li>Positions that have been  vacant for over two years are reviewed for continued relevancy.</li><li>Positions that have been  vacant for five years or longer are deleted.</li><li>When abolishing vacant  positions, the organizational structures are reviewed to assess impacts on  subordinate and supervisory positions.</li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Typically, vacant positions should represent no more than  10% to 15% of an organization's total population. This includes banks of vacant  positions maintained for the purpose of developmental programs or ongoing  temporary needs, such as seasonal recruitment.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix C - Classification  Documentation and Data Management Requirements"><p>Complete and accurate classification documentation and  information contained in the departmental classification files, human resources  information management systems and the Office of the Chief Human Resources  Officer ’s information management systems, including the interdepartmental  Position and Classification Information System (PCIS) contributes to:</p><ul><li>accountability and transparency of departmental classification       programs because it records the basis upon which classification decisions       have been made; and</li><li>efficient conduct of various classification activities including       relativity studies, auditing and monitoring.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>For each classification  action, the following documents are required on the classification file  (electronic or paper):

<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>Job description
  <ul><li>describing the duties  and responsibilities of the position;</li><li>signed and dated by the  manager; and </li><li>indicating the effective  date.</li></ul></li><li>Organization chart
<ul><li>depicting the  organizational location of the position and its relationship to the other  positions in the same unit or division; and</li><li>signed and dated by the  manager. </li></ul></li><li>Classification action form (“Electronic  Position Action Report”)
<ul><li>signed by an accredited  HR advisor with sub-delegated classification authority or a manager with  sub-delegated classification authority. </li></ul></li><li>Classification evaluation rationale for the  classification decision
<ul><li>substantiating the  occupational group and level of the position and reflecting benchmark  comparisons; and </li><li>signed by all the  committee members, if a committee was used to classify the job or by an  accredited HR advisor, if a committee was not used. </li></ul></li><li>Analysis and summary of the relevant  departmental and interdepartmental classification relativity.</li><li>Job validation report, if a job validation  review was conducted.</li><li>Statement from  the manager summarizing the evolution of the work when a reclassification is  being proposed.</li><li>For a reclassification, information that  substantiates the selection of the effective date.</li><li>Any other data, reports or information that  substantiate the classification decision.</li><li>National Occupational Classification code.</li><li>When a  standardized job description is applied, information that substantiates the  decision to apply that particular job description such as an e-mail or notation  on the human resources request from the manager.</li></ol></li><li>For each classification  decision, organizations must ensure the completeness and accuracy of:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>classification file  documentation;</li><li>data entered in the departmental  human resources information management system ; and</li><li>data transferred to the Office  of the Chief Human Resources Officer information management systems, including but not limited to Position  and Classification Information System.</li></ol></li><li>Classification evaluation  data is entered in the departmental human resources management system to  facilitate data upload to PCIS on a monthly basis.</li><li>The Disclosure of  Position Reclassification is posted on the departmental web site on a quarterly  basis.</li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>In the case of standardized job description records where  more than one position has identical duties and responsibilities,  classification records may consist of a complete set for one of the positions  (i.e. a master file), to which the remainder are cross-referenced.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="D" title="Appendix D - Effective Dates and  Retroactivity of Classification Decisions"><p>Effective dates establish when the work described in the  job description has officially been assigned to a position.</p><p>Managers are responsible for establishing the effective  date, which must be reasonable and evidence-based. </p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>The effective date of the  duties described in the job description is confirmed prior to issuing the  classification decision.</li><li>When a reclassification is  proposed, a reasonable and evidence-based effective date will be established  taking into consideration the following:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>when all or parts of the work  were added;</li><li>when all or parts of the work  were added at the same time; and </li><li>the parts of the work that made  the difference in group allocation and/or level.</li></ol></li><li>Information that validates  the selection of the effective date for a reclassification is placed on the  classification file.</li><li>If a position is new or  when an existing position is updated / reviewed and there is no change in  duties, the effective date reflects the point at which the job has been  officially classified.</li><li>The effective date of a new  position may be retroactive if:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>the new position is being  created to compensate an employee retroactively for work performed;</li><li>the new position is being  created as a result of an upheld grievance.</li></ol></li><li>Departmental classification  programs should include direction on the level of approval and approval process  required for effective dates carrying a long retroactivity period (i.e. 6  months or more).</li></ol><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>In the case of a reclassification, employees may be  entitled to retroactive pay for the period during which they have been performing  all aspects of the newly assigned work. As a best practice, when a  reclassification is being proposed, the manager is encouraged to discuss the  effective date with the HR advisor and employee(s) prior to the classification  evaluation.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="E" title="Appendix E - Classification Relativity"><p>Classification relativity analysis is used in the job  evaluation process. It involves the comparison of jobs within the organization  (i.e. internal or departmental relativity) and – where relevant – with similar  jobs, in similar organizational contexts, in other organizations (i.e. external  or interdepartmental relativity) to ensure a consistent application of job  evaluation standards and the appropriateness of classification decisions within  the organization and across the CPA.</p><p>Although the application of occupational group  definitions, inclusion and exclusion statements, job evaluation standards and  related benchmarks take precedence over a relativity analysis, this analysis is  valuable in ensuring that similar jobs, in similar organizational contexts and  environments produce consistent classification evaluation results.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>When a job evaluation  occurs, a classification relativity analysis is conducted.</li><li>When a classification  relativity analysis is conducted:
    <ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>the organizational context  within which the work is performed is taken into consideration when comparing  job descriptions and evaluation results in different organizations; and </li><li>a brief analysis and summary of  the relevant departmental and interdepartmental relativity is placed on the  classification file of the position being evaluated. </li></ol></li><li>To ensure the maintenance  of appropriate departmental and interdepartmental classification relativities:
    <ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>organizations consult with the  Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer prior to authorizing any classification decisions that may have a  significant impact on interdepartmental relativity or result in a significant  increase of salary expenditures; </li><li>standardized job descriptions  are used wherever possible as they are supportive of relativity when  appropriately applied (e.g. in the intended organizational context) and unique  job descriptions are used on an exceptional basis; </li><li>job descriptions, including  standardized job descriptions, developed in other organizations are evaluated  within the new organizational context before they are implemented in a new  organization; </li><li>classification anomalies are not  replicated; </li><li>information and documentation,  such as job descriptions, organizational charts and rationales, are shared  among organizations for the purpose of relativity analysis; </li><li>classification data is complete  and accurate in the departmental human resources information management  systems and monthly updates are made to  the interdepartmental Position and Classification Information System ; and</li><li>National Occupational  Classification codes are assigned to jobs whenever classification evaluations  occur and are entered into the departmental human resources information  management system for subsequent transfer to the Position and Classification  Information System. </li></ol></li></ol></appendix><appendix anchor="F" title="Appendix F - Classification  Disagreements and Impasses"><p>In the event of a disagreement about a classification  evaluation or when a job evaluation committee reaches an impasse and is unable  to come to a consensus, resolution is sought through a departmental process.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>A process is in place in  the organization to resolve classification disagreements and impasses where  consensus is not achieved between or among HR advisors, classification  committees and/or managers.</li><li>Upon request, all relevant  information pertaining to the classification decision is provided to the  manager by the accredited HR advisor to ensure mutual understanding of all  issues affecting the decision.</li></ol><p><strong>Note </strong></p><p>The resolution process may include referral to a senior  departmental officer with classification authority, an HR advisor or a job  evaluation committee (departmental or interdepartmental) not involved in the  original classification evaluation.</p><p>As a best practice, informal discussions between  accredited HR advisors and managers take place before a classification decision  is made or escalating the matter.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="G" title="Appendix G - Job Evaluation"><p>Job evaluation (classification evaluation) is the process  of assessing the relative worth of jobs within an organization. Ultimately, it establishes a hierarchy of  jobs within the organization. </p><p>The job evaluation process is the same regardless whether  there is a job evaluation committee or a single evaluator.</p><p>Job evaluation committees contribute to sound  classification decisions by:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>reducing personal biases about  the work. The requirement for all parties to reach consensus ensures that all  information is shared and clarification is sought when required; </li><li>bringing greater knowledge about  the work, the organizational context and relativities to the job evaluation  process. Such insight may not be available if a single evaluator is used; </li><li>supporting transparency in the  evaluation process; and</li><li>promoting gender neutrality in  classification decisions by having men and women participating in the  evaluation process. </li></ol><p>Organizations must ensure that all classification  decisions are arrived at in a transparent, equitable and consistent manner, and  that these decisions are appropriate and supportable.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>A job evaluation committee  is required when:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>the evaluation outcome may have  a significant impact on departmental and interdepartmental relativity or result  in a significant increase of salary expenditures;</li><li>there is the likelihood of a  reclassification;</li><li>the evaluation outcome may be  precedent setting;</li><li>the job description applies to  several positions;</li><li>the position to be evaluated is  contentious and the need for credibility and transparency is paramount;</li><li>a new organizational structure  with the potential to set new or impact existing relativities is being  implemented; and</li><li>a new occupational group is  introduced in the organization.</li></ol></li><li>Job evaluators/job  evaluation committees must ensure that they have complete and comprehensive  information and documentation about the job or the position to be evaluated,  including:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>a current, signed and dated  organization chart that accurately reflects the organizational location of the  position and its relationship to other positions in the same unit or division;</li><li>a signed and dated job  description that reflects the work assigned and performed/to be performed;</li><li>information supporting the  chosen effective date;</li><li>classification relativity  analysis;</li><li>any additional information that  may assist in evaluating the job/position, e.g. project descriptions,  legislation, etc.</li></ol></li><li>Any additional information  obtained during the job evaluation process is documented on the classification  file.</li><li>Job descriptions and  standardized job descriptions developed in other organizations are evaluated  within the new organizational context before they are implemented in a new  organization.</li><li>The use of an  interdepartmental job evaluation committee is recommended when:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>the classification decision  relates to positions found in many or most organizations and may be precedent  setting for the CPA;</li><li>interdepartmental relativity  concerns are at issue; and</li><li>an organization does not have a  sufficient pool of trained committee members with the particular expertise  required for the purpose of objective deliberations.</li></ol></li><li>A job evaluation committee  is normally composed of:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>three members, comprising; </li><li>an accredited HR advisor;</li><li>at least one trained manager;</li><li>a member with the required level  of sub-delegated classification authority to authorize the resulting  classification decision (manager or accredited HR advisor); and </li><li>both men and women. </li></ol></li><li>As a whole, job evaluation  committee members should be knowledgeable about:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>the relevant job evaluation  standard;</li><li>the work being evaluated;  and </li><li>the organization in which the  work is performed. </li></ol></li><li>Job evaluation committee  members and single job evaluators:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>are trained in job evaluation, as  per the <em>Organization and Classification Learning Curriculum</em> requirements; </li><li>are not in a conflict of  interest situation i.e. they should not be in a position to benefit, either  personally or operationally, from the results of the evaluation;</li><li>understand classification  including the job evaluation standards and the process of allocating positions  to occupational groups, including the use of the <em>Table of Concordance</em> and the  <em>Guide to Allocating Positions Using the 1999 Occupational Group Definitions</em>;</li><li>apply the job evaluation  standards consistently and appropriately in accordance with classification  policy instruments;</li><li>are aware and free of personal  biases and do not make assumptions about the work being evaluated – namely,  principles of consistency and gender neutrality are respected; </li><li>do not substitute their own  knowledge for that of the manager, the employee in the position or the  information provided in the job description; and</li><li>do not make assumptions about  the work or current hierarchical relationships as it introduces bias into the  evaluation process.</li></ol></li><li>When a job evaluation  committee is used, the following steps are followed to ensure that the  committee operates effectively and efficiently:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>prior to the job evaluation  committee, the committee chair reviews the job description to ensure that it  contains all the relevant information and is accompanied by a complete and  current organizational chart and other supporting documentation required per  the job evaluation standard; </li><li>the committee chair provides  each committee member with the complete and relevant classification  documentation prior to the job evaluation committee convening; </li><li>each committee member first  evaluates the job description independently, in preparation for the committee; </li><li>the sponsoring manager provides  information and answers questions from the committee as required; </li><li>the committee chair (accredited  HR advisor or HR advisor trainee under the guidance of an accredited HR  advisor) provides additional information as applicable and technical expertise  on the application of the job evaluation standard; </li><li>once all the necessary  information has been collected and supporting documentation provided, the  committee members review the job description and allocate it to an occupational  group and sub-group (if applicable), referring to the <em>Table of Concordance</em>; </li><li>the appropriateness of the  occupational group allocation within the organizational structure and  organization's mandate is analyzed;</li><li>once the work has been  allocated to an occupational group, and sub-group if applicable, the subsequent  steps to be followed are those detailed in the appropriate job evaluation  standard; </li><li>the internal and external  classification relativity of similar positions is analyzed and considered; </li><li>the final decision is arrived  at by consensus rather than through voting or majority rule. The evaluation  process is a search for the most appropriate rating; the committee makes every  effort to resolve differences and reach an agreement on the rating; and </li><li>if a consensus cannot be  reached, the classification impasse is settled using the departmental process.</li></ol></li><li>Organizations consult with  the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer prior to authorizing any classification decisions that may have a  significant impact on interdepartmental relativity or result in a significant  increase of salary expenditures</li></ol><p><strong>Note </strong></p><p>Personal performance (unless an employee-oriented  evaluation plan is being used), recruiting difficulties, salaries, or the  present classification (group or level) of the position are not to be  considered in the evaluation process. Making assumptions about the work or  current hierarchical relationships introduces bias about its value into the  evaluation process. </p><p>As a best practice, accredited HR advisors should provide  a quality review of the job description prior to the job evaluation to ensure  that all relevant information is adequately captured.</p><p>Percentage of time is not a reliable indicator in  determining the primary purpose of the job.</p></appendix><appendix anchor="H" title="Appendix H - Job Descriptions"><p>The CPA classification program is position-based. The  work assigned to individual positions is described in a job description and  evaluated by applying the occupational group and sub-group definitions and the  appropriate job evaluation standard. The resulting occupational group,  sub-group (if applicable), and level provide a basis for the compensation of  employees in the CPA.</p><p>Poorly described work can result in erroneous  classification decisions which, in turn, may cause employee dissatisfaction,  recruitment and retention difficulties, and grievances. Furthermore, if a job  description is under-classified, it might adversely affect employees' career  advancement. If a job description is over-classified, it will lead to  inefficient use of salary dollars and could potentially create an inappropriate  precedent for reclassification of similar jobs.</p><p>It is important to maintain the currency and accuracy of  job descriptions, particularly as the work changes or new work is assigned. </p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ol><li>Organizations  must ensure that:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>job descriptions are reviewed  within a reasonable time frame (preferably in five (5) year cycles) and as soon  as possible when significant changes in the work occur or when new work is  assigned; </li><li>standardized job descriptions  are developed and implemented wherever possible for jobs exclusive to the  organization;</li><li>interdepartmental standardized  job descriptions are implemented wherever possible and are applied  appropriately, including application within the intended organizational context  and environment; and</li><li>unique job descriptions are used  on an exceptional basis.</li></ol></li><li>Managers must ensure that:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>they design organizational  structures that support the mandate and business requirements of the  organization, are efficient and cost effective;</li><li>job descriptions in their area  of responsibility reflect the work assigned and performed by their employees,  are updated as the work changes or new work is assigned and have reasonable and  evidence-based effective dates;</li><li>they use standardized job  descriptions wherever possible; and</li><li>they consult with accredited HR  advisors as required to obtain advice on organizational design, the content and  format of job descriptions, the application of job descriptions and  standardized job descriptions within their organizational context, and the  establishment of reasonable and evidence-based effective dates</li></ol></li><li>A job description must have  the following characteristics:
