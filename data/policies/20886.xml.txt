on Disposal of Surplus Materiel</a></em>,whenever practical, departments must make 
surplus materiel assets available, whether gratuitously, at book value, or at market 
value, to other federal departments and agencies before disposing of them outside 
the federal domain. </p><p><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12176">Treasury Board 
Accounting Standard 3.1 - Capital Assets</a></em>requires that transfers of capital 
assets between departments be recorded at the net book value of the asset regardless 
of whether the capital asset was transferred to another departmentgratuitously, 
at book value, or at the market value. As such, the receiving department must record 
the capital asset at its original historical cost and also record the accumulated 
amortization at the date of transfer. In addition, the transferred capital asset's 
historical cost and accumulated amortization amounts must be removed from the books 
of the transferring department. As a result, the accounting treatment should not 
produce a gain or loss, and there should be no impact at the government-wide level. 
 Given the fact that interdepartmental transfers are related party transactions, 
the equity accounts of the departments should be credited or debited with the net 
book value of the capital asset. </p><p>Furthermore, the transferring departments are not allowed to re-spend the agreed 
upon amounts from interdepartmental transfers of surplus assets because the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-27">Surplus Crown Assets Act</a></em> 
only enables departments to re-spend the sale proceeds when the sales are entered 
into with third parties. Please consult your departmental program analyst at the 
Treasury Board Secretariat to pursue access to the agreed upon amounts. The accounting 
treatment of the capital assets transferred is separate from the transfer of funds 
between departments.</p><p>To avoid any effect on government reporting, departments should coordinate their 
accounting entries to ensure that they occur in the same period.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="References"><ul><li><em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-27">Surplus Crown Assets Act</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12176">TBAS 3.1 - Capital Assets</a></em></li><li><em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12066">Directive on Disposal of Surplus Materiel</a></em></li><li>CICA 3840 – Related party transactions</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="Accounting entries"><h3>1.

FRA 16133 and its accumulated amortization under FRA 16233 will be removed from 
the transferring department's books and recorded in the receiving department's books. 
 Since the transfer is done at the net book value between departments, there should 
not be any gain or loss on the transaction. Therefore, the equity account FRA 37DDD 
will be used for net book value.</p></dd><dt><strong>Authority coding rationale:  </strong></dt><dd><p>Since the spending authorities 
were affected when the asset was purchased by the department, the appropriations 
are not affected as a result of interdepartmental transfers. To assist with departmental 
reconciliations, F codes are used for these non-appropriated amounts. F319 is used 
for the adjustment of the capital asset, and F311 is used for accumulated amortization.
