Effective Date"><p>1.1 This standard takes effect on July 1, 2010.</p><p>1.2 It
replaces the following Treasury Board policy instruments: Government On-Line
Metadata Standard (TBITS 39.1) and Controlled Vocabulary Standard (TBITS 39.2).
</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. Application"><p>2.1 This
standard applies to departments as defined in section 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/" title="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"><em>Financial Administration
Act</em></a>, unless excluded by specific acts, regulations or Orders in Council.</p><p>2.2 In
this standard, any reference to all or part of national or international
standards or specifications shall be construed as a reference to the most
recent version of those standards or specifications, as well as any officially
issued correction. Any change to referenced national or international standards
or specifications that affect this standard shall be implemented no later than
one year after the effective date of the change.</p><p>2.3 Those
portions of sections 6.5.1, 6.5.2 and 7.1 relating to the role of the Treasury
Board Secretariat in monitoring compliance and directing consequences for non-compliance
do not apply with respect to the Office of the Auditor General, the Office of
the Privacy Commissioner, the Office of the Information Commissioner, the
Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, the Office of the Commissioner of
Lobbying, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages and the Office
of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The deputy heads of these
organizations are solely responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance
with the standard within their organizations, as well as for responding to
cases of non-compliance in accordance with any Treasury Board instruments
providing principles and guidance on the management of compliance.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Context"><p>3.1  This
standard supports the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742">Policy on Information Management</a> and <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755">Policy on Management of Information Technology</a> by outlining
information management (IM) and information technology (IT) requirements for
the departmental IM Senior Official, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or
equivalent, information management functional specialists, and employees in the
area of metadata.</p><p>3.2  Metadata
defines and describes the structure and meaning of information resources, and
the context and systems in which they exist. It is used to support efficient and
effective management of these information resources over time.</p><p>3.3  The
consistent creation, capture and use of metadata contribute to the objectives
of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742">Policy on Information Management</a> and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16552">Directive on Recordkeeping</a> to manage
information as a strategic asset by supporting the capture, description, retrieval,
use, re-use, accessibility, sharing, authenticity, reliability, integrity, and
maintenance of information resources to facilitate decision-making,
accountability, and the efficient delivery of Government programs and services.</p><p>3.4  Standardized
metadata in the design, documentation and implementation of systems and
components supports interoperability within and across systems, and re-use of
information resources within departments and across the Government of Canada
(GC) to the extent that government laws and policies permit it.</p><p>3.5 Along
with standardized metadata, consistent use of value domains supports the
exchange of information resources within and across systems.  Value domains
include, but are not limited to, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies,
ontologies, thesauri, reference data, authority lists, naming conventions, and
value string instructions.</p><p>3.6 The
requirements of this standard apply to the following domains:</p><div class="indent1"><p>3.6.1 <strong>Recordkeeping</strong>: Recordkeeping metadata
	supports recordkeeping as a management function through which information
	resources of business value are created, acquired, captured, and managed in
	departmental repositories over time, and used as a strategic asset to support
	effective decision making and facilitate ongoing operations and the
	delivery of programs and services.</p><p>3.6.2 <strong>Web resource
	discovery</strong>: Web resource discovery metadata supports the navigation, searching,
	display and sharing of Web information resources. </p><p>3.6.3 <strong>Web content management systems</strong>:
	Web content management system (WCMS) metadata supports business and technical
	processes for authoring, managing and publishing Web content in Web content
	management systems.</p></div><p>3.7 A related standard, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16553&amp;section=text"><em>Standard
on Geospatial Data</em></a>, establishes requirements for geospatial
metadata. </p><p>3.8 This
standard is issued pursuant to section 7 of the <em>Financial
Administration Act</em>.</p><p>3.9 This
standard is to be read in conjunction with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12742"><em>Policy on Information Management</em></a>, the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755"><em>Policy on Management of Information Technology</em></a> and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16552"><em>Directive on Recordkeeping</em></a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4 Definitions"><p>4.1 Definitions

reliability, integrity through the consistent capture,
description, retrieval, use, re-use, and maintenanceof information resources, regardless of systems in
which they exist, and across departments; and</p><p>5.2.2 The ability of programs and services to share
