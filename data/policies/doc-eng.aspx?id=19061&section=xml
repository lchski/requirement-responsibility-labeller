Introduction"><p>The purpose of this
	guideline is to assist departmental managers in meeting their
	responsibilities under the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on Transfer
	Payments</em></a> and the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208"><em>Directive on
	Transfer Payments</em></a> as they relate to recipient audits (see <a href="#appA">Appendix
	A</a> for key excerpts from both the policy and directive).<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnr1" title="See footnote 1">1</a></sup> This guideline provides an overview of
	the recipient audit process and is a non-mandatory tool to assist departmental
	managers. Departmental managers are encouraged to share this guideline with
	their auditor to assist in planning and decision making related to a recipient
	audit.</p><p>Deputy heads' responsibilities include ensuring
	cost-effective oversight and internal control<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnr2" title="See footnote 2">2</a></sup> to support the management of transfer
	payments. This oversight includes recipient monitoring, which includes
	recipient audits. Administrative requirements on recipients, including those
	related to recipient monitoring, are to be in proportion to the risk level.
	Recipient monitoring, reporting and auditing are to reflect risks specific to
	the program, the value of funding in relation to administrative costs and the
	risk profile of the recipient. Transfer payments are to be managed in a manner
	that is sensitive to risks, complexity, accountability for results and economic
	use of resources.</p><p>Recipient monitoring relates to activities undertaken
	or coordinated by a departmental manager to control risks related to a
	recipient and to ensure compliance with obligations and performance objectives
	in a funding agreement. Activities may include the following:</p><ul><li>Confirming documentation from the recipient; </li><li>Contacting the recipient for monitoring purposes; </li><li>Assessing recipient reports (financial and performance) in a timely manner; </li><li>Reviewing project progress periodically; </li><li>Visiting the recipient on-site; and </li><li>Conducting a recipient audit. </li></ul><p>It is expected that the level of monitoring increases
	proportionally with the importance or sensitivity, complexity and materiality
	of a program; the value of funding; and the risk profile of the recipient.</p><p>Departmental managers are responsible for determining
	when recipient audits are necessary to complement other departmental monitoring
	activities. They are also responsible for developing and executing a risk-based
	plan for these recipient audits. When a recipient audit is necessary, a
	departmental manager is responsible for determining its scope, standards to be
	applied and the nature of the report to be provided to the department. The
	departmental manager is also responsible for communicating this information to
	the selected independent auditor.</p><p>As set out in section 7 of this guideline,
	departmental managers are strongly encouraged to coordinate recipient audits of
	a single recipient both within the department and, to the extent possible, with
	other departments, whenever feasible. This is consistent with recommendation 19
	of the Independent Blue Ribbon Panel on Grant and Contribution Programs. See <a href="#appC">Appendix C</a> for this and other recommendations relevant to
	recipient audits.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="2. What Is and What Is Not a Recipient Audit?"><p>A recipient audit is an independent assessment to
	provide assurance on a recipient's compliance with a funding agreement. The
	scope of a recipient audit may address any or all financial and non-financial
	aspects of the funding agreement. The funding agreement is generally for a
	contribution; however, grant funding agreements may include recipient audit
	provisions where a department deems them appropriate. </p><p>A recipient audit involves reviewing and possibly
	testing compliance with a funding agreement and may include the following: </p><ul><li>Reviewing tasks performed by the recipient in conducting its activity, initiative or project; </li><li>Testing the validity of any reports submitted; </li><li>Assessing internal controls related to the funding agreement; </li><li>Reviewing eligibility of expenditures incurred by the recipient; and </li><li>Confirming that performance objectives defined in the funding agreement are being achieved. </li></ul><p>The decision to conduct a recipient audit and its
	comprehensiveness is risk-based. This is discussed further in section 4,
	"Selection of Recipients for Recipient Audit," and section 5.2, "Level of
	assurance-Audit, review engagement and specified auditing procedures."</p><p>A recipient audit does not encompass other unrelated
	activities of the recipient, and it is not an audit of financial statements of
	the recipient that has a broader scope. The audit of the financial statements
	of the recipient is when the auditor expresses an opinion that the entity's
	financial statements present fairly the balance sheet, the income statement,
	notes to the financial statements, etc. in all material or significant respects
	for the year just ended in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles (accounting standards). A financial statement audit is not
	considered a good substitute for a recipient audit, because it does not
	generally indicate if costs reported or claimed by the recipient are in
	compliance with a particular funding agreement. However, a financial statement
	audit may contribute to the decision to conduct a recipient audit.</p><p>A recipient audit is also different from a
	departmental internal audit. The purpose of a departmental internal audit is to
	provide assurances on the effectiveness and adequacy of departmental risk
	management, control and governance processes. An example of a process that can
	be audited by internal audit personnel is the program management recipient
	monitoring process, which includes recipient audits performed for program
	management. Consequently, while it is recommend that internal audit personnel
	not perform recipient audits, they may audit the monitoring process performed
	by departmental managers. </p><p>See <a href="#appD">Appendix D</a> for an overview of the
	different types of audits.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="3. Benefits of Conducting a Recipient Audit"><p>The benefits of conducting a recipient audit, when appropriate, are numerous. Recipient audits may:</p><ul><li>Confirm that funds are or are not being used for intended purposes;</li><li>Confirm previously identified issues and the extent of the problem (e.g., poor cash management, weak governance, limited reporting);</li><li>Identify previously unknown risks with certain recipients, projects or
		initiatives that can lead to the departmental manager adjusting monitoring or
		funding agreements;</li><li>Provide additional useful information for decision making; </li><li>Act as a possible deterrent to recipient fraud or non-compliance with the funding agreement;</li><li>Complement the role of the internal audit function; and</li><li>Support the roles of the departmental audit committee and the chief financial officer.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="4. Selection of Recipients for Recipient Audit"><p>Selecting recipients for audit first requires an
	assessment of risk. Risk management of transfer payments can be viewed at
	several levels within a department. Integrated risk management is a method for
	managing overall risk within a department. Risk management at the grant and
	contribution program level as well as risk management at the project or
	recipient level feeds into the Integrated Risk Management Framework. Risk
	management at all levels within a department should be integrated to allow for
	sharing and updating of risk information.</p><p>At the project or recipient level, recipients are
	selected for audit after being assessed for risks by departmental managers
	(with assistance from program officers, as required) or as recommended to
	departmental managers for selection by other functional experts, such as the
	departmental evaluation group. Whatever means of recipient selection used, the
	departmental manager is to be satisfied that the overall monitoring, including
	recipient audit, is adequate.</p><p>This section focuses on risk management at the project or recipient level.  </p><section anchor="4.1" title="4.1 Risk management model-Project or recipient level"><p>A risk management model for transfer payments at the
		project or recipient level is a tool that identifies risk factors and risk
		ratings that can be used to assess the overall risk related to a particular
		recipient. It is recommended that the risk management model be applied prior to
		a funding agreement being signed with a recipient and re-applied throughout the
		duration of the agreement, as needed.</p><p>The risk management model (see partial illustrative
		example below) can include the following:</p><ul><li>Risk factors: Areas of risk developed with consideration of such items
			as performance risks (stated objectives of projects not achieved), financial
			risks (funding may not be used for intended purpose or reported accurately),
			and risk tolerances;<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnr3" title="See footnote 3">3</a></sup></li><li>Risk assessment scale or risk rating: For each risk factor, the range of
			ratings for that risk factor based on assessment criteria;</li><li>Assessment criteria: Conditions to be considered in assigning a relevant
			risk rating to a risk factor for a particular recipient;</li><li>Weighting of risk factor: Value assigned to each risk factor in relation
			to overall risk score based on its relative importance or impact as compared
			with other risk factors;</li><li>Overall risk score: Measure of overall risk related to a particular
			recipient based on the above four bullets (e.g., low to high); and</li><li>Risk assessment scoring matrix: The overall risk level based on the
			overall risk score.</li></ul><table class="rpp widthFull"><caption class="alignLeft"><strong>Illustrative example</strong></caption><thead><tr class="lightgreyBG"><th scope="col" class="alignCenter"><strong>Risk Factor</strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignCenter"><strong>Risk Rating</strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignCenter"><strong>Assessment Criteria</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="rowgroup" rowspan="3" class="alignLeft">Recipient's capability of managing project</th><th scope="row" class="alignCenter">High</th><td class="alignTop"><ul><li>Limited or no qualified team members</li><li>High staff turnover</li><li>Unclear roles and responsibilities</li><li>Limited or no internal capacity to recruit, train and retain appropriate personnel</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignCenter">Medium</th><td class="alignTop"><ul><li>Some qualified team members</li><li>Moderate staff turnover</li><li>Some clarity regarding roles and responsibilities</li><li>Some internal capacity to recruit, train and retain appropriate personnel</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="alignCenter">Low</th><td class="alignTop"><ul><li>Sufficient number of qualified team members</li><li>Low staff turnover</li><li>Clear roles and responsibilities</li><li>Strong internal capacity to recruit, train and retain appropriate personnel</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></section><section anchor="4.2" title="4.2 Risk-based plans-Program and departmental levels"><p>Based on the results from the risk management model at
			the project or recipient level, a risk-based plan for recipient audits at the program
			level can be developed by the departmental manager, as required. As per section
			6.5.3 of the <em>Directive on Transfer Payments</em>, departmental managers are
			responsible for "determining when recipient audits are necessary to complement
			other departmental monitoring activities, and developing and executing a risk-based
			plan for these recipient audits."</p><p>Some departments may have in place a
			departmental-driven risk assessment and management system where the
			departmental manager inputs risk data related to a particular recipient and
			funding agreement. The system will advise the departmental manager on
			appropriate monitoring activities, including the need for a recipient audit.
			Alternatively, a department may have a more manual risk assessment and
			management system that departmental managers use at their discretion in
			determining appropriate monitoring activities for a recipient.</p><p>The output from the risk management model discussed in
			section 4.1 can be a risk mitigation strategy like the one shown below, which outlines
			suggested activities based on assessed risk. This strategy can help
			departmental managers prepare a program risk-based plan for recipient audits.
			The illustrative example below suggests that there be mandatory recipient
			audits for recipients that have been assessed as having an overall high-risk
			level<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnr4" title="See footnote 4">4</a></sup>
			and random selection<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnr5" title="See footnote 5">5</a></sup>
			for recipient audit of recipients that have low- to medium-risk levels. </p><table class="rpp widthFull"><caption class="alignLeft"><strong>Illustrative example of possible mitigation

			audits of a particular transfer payment program, the departmental manager should
			be clear on the plan's intent. In some cases, the intent may be to focus
			recipient audits on recipients where risks appear highest. Alternatively, or
			additionally, the departmental manager may wish to design the risk-based plan
			to allow general conclusions to be reached about recipient compliance across
			the program; this requires that a statistically valid sample of recipients be
			subject to audit.</p><p>In preparing risk-based plans, departmental managers
			are to use discretion if, in their judgment, a recipient audit should or should
			not be conducted (e.g., override of the departmental risk management model).<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnr6" title="See footnote 6">6</a></sup> 
			A departmental manager may decide that a
			recipient audit is not necessary because reliable alternative sources of
			assurance may meet their needs, such as:</p><ul><li>A departmental "initial visit" to the recipient to reach a common understanding of the funding agreement and to clarify financial reporting and
				documentation expectations;</li><li>Recent recipient audit(s) of the recipient for another departmental program or by another department with appropriate commonality;</li><li>Representations<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnr7" title="See footnote 7">7</a></sup> by recipient officials;</li><li>Representations by the recipient's external auditor;</li><li>The recipient's audited financial statements;<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnr8" title="See footnote 8">8</a></sup></li><li>Recipient reports or results that are better than anticipated, with appropriate evidence;  </li><li>Internal audits conducted by the recipient; and</li><li>Evaluations conducted by the department.</li></ul><p>Departmental managers' risk-based plans at the program
		level may be useful for preparing a consolidated departmental level risk-based
		plan, if desired. Such a plan may help departments ensure a more coordinated approach
		for recipient audits of the same recipient. <a href="#appE">Appendix E</a>
		illustrates a possible format of risk-based plans and highlights the need
		to properly document processes and decisions.  </p><p>Much of the material in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this
		document related to risk management models has been drawn from <em>Guidance on
		the Design and Application of Risk Management Tools for Grants &amp;
		Contributions Projects</em>, by the Interdepartmental Working Group on Grants
		and Contributions Risk Management.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnr9" title="See footnote 9">[9]</a></sup>  Another source of information on risk management models is the Treasury Board's
		<em>Integrated Risk Management Framework</em>. <strong>Due to the simplification of
		the material in sections 4.1.and 4.2, it is recommended that more detailed material,
		such as that referred to above, be considered before beginning a risk
		management project.</strong></p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="5. Recipient Audit Parameters"><p>Recipient audit parameters are the elements that need
	to be decided upon by the departmental manager before a department negotiates
	and signs an agreement for recipient audit services. These parameters are
	discussed in sections 5.1 to 5.5.</p><section anchor="5.1" title="5.1 Establishing audit provisions in funding agreements"><p>To conduct recipient audits, funding agreements need audit provisions. <br /><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#appG">Appendix G</a> of the <em>Directive on Transfer Payments </em>identifies 
		elements needed to establish the department's right to conduct recipient audits and to access
		the recipient's documents and premises. Specifically, it identifies the following:</p><ul><li>The minister's right to undertake a recipient audit to determine whether
			the recipient has complied with the funding agreement; and</li><li>The minister's right of access to the recipient's documents and premises
			for the purpose of conducting an audit or monitoring compliance with the
			funding agreement. </li></ul><p>Departments are reminded that the performance of
		recipient audits for transfer payments programs, other than contributions,
		require similar elements in funding agreements or some other legal basis. As
		well, recipient audit provisions are not always required in contributions
		agreements with other orders of government<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnr10" title="See footnote 10">10</a></sup> or with foreign recipients.
		 Funding agreements for grants normally do not have recipient audit
		provisions; however, these may be included where a department deems them
		appropriate.</p><p>With regard to access to the recipient's documents, a
		minimum period of right of access after the end of the funding agreement should
		be considered, at the discretion of departmental managers or at a higher
		program policy level. In such a case, the minister has right of access to
		documents related to the expired funding agreement (three to five years past
		the end of the funding agreement seems reasonable). </p><p>It is recommended that departments consult with
		departmental contracting and procurement staff and/or legal services to
		determine the precise wording for funding agreements in order to allow for
		recipient audits and right of access.  </p></section><section anchor="5.2" title="5.2 Level of assurance-Audit, review engagement and specified auditing procedures"><p>The level of assurance is the degree of confidence
		that the departmental manager has in the conclusion of the recipient audit
		report. The level of assurance is linked to the nature of engagement conducted
		by the auditor. An audit provides high or reasonable assurance, whereas a
		review engagement provides moderate assurance. </p><p>In determining the appropriate level of assurance for
		a recipient audit, the departmental manager is to be guided by recipient risk
		as well as by an awareness of the nature of different types of engagements that
		an auditor can conduct. An audit engagement includes such procedures as inspection,
		observation, enquiry, confirmation, recalculation and analytical procedures. A
		review engagement consists primarily of enquiry, analytical procedures and
		discussion of information provided by the recipient, with the level of work
		being less extensive than for an audit. </p><p>For the same subject matter, an audit engagement can
		be expected to be more costly than a review engagement due to the greater level
		of work to achieve the higher level of assurance. Costs and benefits of higher
		assurance are to be considered as well as what is being audited. Non-financial
		clauses in funding agreements can be very costly to audit to a high assurance
		level. As well, it may not be possible to obtain a high assurance given the
		information available or the nature of the clause. </p><p>For a particular funding agreement and the clauses
		selected for a recipient audit, a departmental manager may decide that high
		assurance is needed for some clauses and moderate assurance for other clauses.
		The mechanics of such a recipient audit should be discussed in detail with the
		auditor.</p><p>Departmental managers have another option available to
		them: specified auditing procedures for which particular information may be
		sought regarding certain clauses in the funding agreement. The auditor simply
		performs specified auditing procedures <strong>as requested and specified by
		the departmental manager</strong>. Specified auditing procedures do not result in
		either an audit opinion<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnr11" title="See footnote 11">11</a></sup>
		or negative assurance<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnr12" title="See footnote 12">12</a></sup>
		but rather provide factual information about certain clauses in a funding
		agreement (e.g., timesheets were available to provide support for 9 of 10
		claims sent to the department). In this way, the departmental manager may be
		able to confirm if there is a legitimate problem and adjust recipient
		monitoring accordingly.  </p><p>Within this guideline, the meaning of "recipient
		audit" and "audit" are different. "Recipient audit," as defined in the <em>Directive
		on Transfer Payments</em>, is an independent assessment to provide assurance on
		a recipient's compliance with a funding agreement. The scope of a recipient
		audit may address any or all financial and non-financial aspects of the funding
		agreement. </p><p>A "recipient audit" can be:</p><ul><li>An "audit" with high or reasonable assurance;</li><li>A review engagement with moderate assurance; or </li><li>Specified auditing procedures with no assurance. </li></ul><p>It is up to the departmental manager to decide what a
		recipient audit means in any particular circumstance, based on assessed risk,
		desired level of assurance and cost-benefit considerations.</p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="5.3 Limitations of a recipient audit"><p>Departmental managers are to be aware of limitations
		that can apply to a recipient audit, such as:</p><ul><li>A recipient audit will not provide absolute assurance (the recipient
			audit cannot provide a 100-per-cent guarantee there will be no errors or
			omissions in the financial or non-financial information or compliance with a
			funding agreement).</li><li>A lower level of assurance can be expected for non-financial clauses due
			to the inherent difficulty of assessing these types of clauses (assessment of
			compliance with non-financial clauses are more difficult due to their less
			objective nature).</li><li>Fraud is more difficult to detect than errors due to efforts made to conceal fraud. </li><li>An auditor very rarely reviews 100 per cent of the relevant financial
			transactions, and, in some cases, even representative sampling<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fnr13" title="See footnote 13">13</a></sup> may not be performed. </li><li>Internal controls have limitations (internal controls would likely not
			detect errors in judgment, collusion between individuals, management override,
			and inappropriate transactions or activities due to inability to properly
			segregate duties due to the size of an organization).</li><li>Much of the evidence reviewed may be persuasive but not conclusive.</li></ul></section><section anchor="5.4" title="5.4 Scope, standards and criteria"><p>The scope of a recipient audit, standards used to
		conduct the recipient audit, and criteria for the recipient audit are key
		concepts for the departmental manager to understand. As per section 6.5.3 of
		the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208"><em>Directive on Transfer Payments</em></a>, departmental managers are
		responsible for "determining the scope of recipient audits to be undertaken and
		the standards to be applied." In addition, as per section 6.5.4 of the <em>Directive
		on Transfer Payments</em>, the departmental manager is responsible for
		"communicating to the auditor the scope of the recipient audit to be undertaken,
		the standards to be followed and the nature of the report to be provided to the
		department."</p><p>The <strong>scope</strong> of a recipient audit refers to what is
		subject to audit. The scope referred to in sections 6.5.3 and 6.5.4 of the <em>Directive
		on Transfer Payments </em>refers to the scope of the recipient audit to be
		undertaken rather than the scope of the recipient audit report. For example,
		the scope of a recipient audit can be the claimed amounts (as defined in the
		terms and conditions of agreement XYZ) for the period April 30, 20XX, to
		September 30, 20XX. Conversely, the "scope" paragraph of a recipient audit
		report may describe the standards by which the recipient audit was conducted,
		the level of assurance and what is included in the recipient audit.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fnr14" title="See footnote 14">14</a></sup></p><p>The <strong>standards</strong> that may be used or may apply to
		a recipient audit are rules by which the auditor conducts the engagement. For
		example, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) has Canadian
		generally accepted auditing standards for audits, which include general,
		examination and reporting standards for various types of engagements. The CICA
		also has Canadian generally accepted standards for review engagements,
		which include general, review and reporting standards. The International
		Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (IIA Standards)
		include attribute and performance standards as well as practice advisories for
		engagements. The material in this guidance document draws extensively from the
		CICA standards, which have been commonly used for recipient audits. However,
		other standards may be appropriate, depending on the anticipated engagement. It
		is recommended that the applicable standards used to conduct a recipient audit
		are referred to in both the agreement for recipient audit services and in the
		recipient audit report. </p><p>Departmental managers are expected to have some
		understanding of standards used by the auditor but not an in-depth knowledge of
		the standards themselves.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fnr15" title="See footnote 15">15</a></sup> <strong>Note that the CICA standards are currently in a
		transition phase. It is recommended that departmental managers seek the
		expertise of auditors in determining the appropriate standards to be used for
		recipient audits.</strong> It is the responsibility of the auditor to have an
		extensive knowledge of standards selected by the departmental manager and to
		conduct the recipient audit by said standards. </p><p><strong>Criteria</strong> are used to assess financial or
		non-financial information against benchmarks. For example, in a financial
		statement audit, financial statements are audited to see if they are in
		accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In the case of a recipient audit, financial or
		non-financial information is assessed to see if it is in accordance with a
		particular funding agreement between the department and the recipient. As
		needed, auditors may develop more detailed criteria related to clauses selected
		for review in the funding agreement. Depending on previous agreement, the
		departmental manager may be given the opportunity to review or approve the more
		detailed criteria before the recipient audit begins.</p></section><section anchor="5.5" title="5.5 Recipient audit report"><p>The purpose of a recipient audit report is for the
		auditor to express a conclusion on the subject matter for which the recipient
		is accountable to the department. The nature of the recipient audit report is
		generally dictated by the nature of the engagement and whether significant
		concerns have been identified during the engagement, including insufficient appropriate evidence. For example, an audit
		has a different style of report than a review engagement. If sufficient
		appropriate evidence is not available, the report will contain a reservation
		explaining the problem. As well, the nature of the report can vary
		depending on whether both financial and non-financial clauses of the funding
		agreement were reviewed during the engagement.</p><p>With the assistance of the auditor, departmental
		managers should consider including an agreed upon recipient audit report
		template in the agreement for audit services.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fnr16" title="See footnote 16">16</a></sup> This helps clarify the departmental
		manager's needs and avoid any misunderstanding about deliverables.</p><p>Departmental managers have several options for
		recipient audit reports. Some examples of recipient audit reports (by assurance
		levels) are shown in <a href="#appG">Appendix G</a>. </p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="6. Auditors and Specialists"><section anchor="6.1" title="6.1 Selection of auditors"><p>Currently, departmental managers have the following
		options available when selecting an independent auditor for a recipient audit:</p><ul><li>Audit Services Canada (ASC); </li><li>Professional Audit Support Services Supply Arrangement (PASS SA), Stream 8 (Recipient and contribution agreement audits); and/or </li><li>A departmental recipient audit group. </li></ul><p>ASC (formerly a component of Consulting and Audit
		Canada) is a special operating agency of the federal government that provides
		audit, assurance and audit-related services to federal departments and agencies.
		Departments can engage ASC through a memorandum of understanding that outlines
		services to be provided and the agreed upon fee.</p><p>The PASS SA is a method of procurement of audit and
		financial management services. The supply arrangement is expected to allow for
		a fast, efficient and streamlined approach to service procurement through an
		existing pre-qualified pool of service providers and its integration into the
		existing procurement system. </p><p>Departments without a dedicated recipient audit group
		have the choice of using either ASC or the PASS SA for their recipient audit
		needs. Departments may be able to engage services through means other than
		these two services if they demonstrate to Public Works and Government Services
		Canada that their needs cannot be met by either.</p><p>However, a department may have a dedicated
		departmental recipient audit group. This group should be staffed with
		indeterminate employees, with any additional staffing needs met by ASC or the
		PASS SA, as appropriate. </p><p>In all cases, recipient audit staff are to have
		sufficient expertise to conduct a recipient audit of both the financial and
		non-financial clauses in the funding agreement, as required. Section 6.2 of
		this guideline discusses the situation where the use of specialists is required
		for recipient audits.</p><p>Section 6.5.4 of the <em>Directive on Transfer Payments</em>
		states that the departmental manager is responsible for "selecting an
		independent auditor to undertake a recipient audit for the department." The
		term "independent auditor" is meant to imply that the auditor is independent of
		the recipient and that a conflict of interest, either actual or perceived, does
		not exist between the auditor and the recipient. The term "independent auditor"
		can also be interpreted to mean that the auditor is free of any bias toward
		program management or the department.</p><p>Currently, some departmental internal audit groups are
		conducting recipient audits. This practice is not encouraged, because recipient
		audits are not within the mandate of internal audit and because of concerns
		about the independence of internal auditors. The role of departmental internal
		audit groups is to provide professional review and assessment, independent of
		line management, of departmental risk management, control and governance
		processes. Internal audit personnel need to maintain their independence in
		order to audit the recipient monitoring process, which includes recipient
		audits. Departmental managers, however, should feel free to seek general advice
		from departmental internal auditors on recipient audit concepts, such as scope,
		standards and reports.</p><p>Departmental contracting and procurement staff should
		be consulted for up-to-date procurement options for recipient audit services,
		as appropriate. </p></section><section anchor="6.2" title="6.2 Use of specialist by the auditor"><title>6.2 Use of specialist by the auditor<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fnr17" title="See footnote 17">17</a></sup></title><p>Departmental managers may decide, in selecting the
		scope of a recipient audit, that both financial and non-financial clauses of the
		funding agreement should be included. The auditor may use the services of one
		or more specialists to ensure sufficient expertise to review all clauses
		selected (e.g., official languages, informatics). The departmental manager and
		the potential auditor should discuss the possible need for a specialist and,
		where appropriate, document this requirement in the agreement for recipient
		audit services.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="7" title="7. Single Recipient Audit"><title>7. Single Recipient Audit</title><p>A single recipient audit<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fnr18" title="See footnote 18">18</a></sup> is a coordinated approach to
	recipient auditing whereby an auditor representing some or all donors conducts
	a single recipient audit of a common recipient to verify compliance with terms
	and conditions of some or all funding agreements with that particular recipient.
	Section 6.5.5 of the <em>Directive on Transfer Payments</em> encourages single
	recipient audits within departments and with other departments, where feasible.
	 </p><p>As a starting point to coordinating single recipient
	audits, departments need a comprehensive list of recipients by program and some
	indication of the risk level. Departments have at least four options that can
	be helpful in providing this information:</p><ul><li>Recipient information from the departmental risk management model, as
		discussed in section 4.1 of this document;</li><li>Public Works and Government Services Canada makes available on its
		website unpublished detailed information by fiscal year relating to Section 6,
		Transfer Payments, of Volume III of the <em>Public Accounts of Canada</em>.
		Section 6 presents, by department and for each class of recipient, a detailed
		list, where applicable, of payments (i.e., cash and accrued charges)
		aggregating to $100,000 or more to a recipient. This list shows the name and
		location of the recipient, with the amount paid;</li><li>Proactive disclosure information, available on departmental websites,
		indicates each grant and contribution greater than $25,000 awarded in the
		previous quarter. Proactive disclosure information indicates the recipient, recipient
		location, date of award, value of award, type of transfer payment and purpose;
		and</li><li>A department may try to promote the benefits of a single recipient audit
		with a recipient and ask the recipient to indicate other programs or other
		associated departments with which it is dealing. With the recipient's
		agreement, the department then contacts other departments or programs and
		suggests the possibility of a single recipient audit. </li></ul><p>An assessment of costs and benefits of coordinating a
	single recipient audit should be conducted before proceeding with a
	collaborative approach to auditing (both within and among departments). As
	well, departmental managers should assess how many and how much of the funding
	agreements with any one recipient should be audited based on an assessment of
	risk.  The departmental Centre of Expertise for transfer payments, should
	it exist, may assist in the facilitation and co-ordination of single recipient
	audits.</p><p>Other issues that need to be considered when assessing
	the feasibility of a single audit include the following:</p><ul><li>A possible process for shared audits within or between departments;</li><li>The impact on the recipient's operations;</li><li>Privacy concerns regarding sharing reports; and </li><li>Element(s) in funding agreements for shared audits. </li></ul><p>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's Centre of
	Expertise on Grants and Contributions has prepared a reference document on
	single recipient audits entitled <em>Single Recipient Audits – Summary of
	Current Practices of Selected Departments.</em></p></chapter><chapter anchor="8" title="8. Agreement Between the Department and the Auditor for Recipient Audit Services"><p>In cases where departments are not using a
	departmental recipient audit group to conduct recipient audits but rather
	seeking the services of ASC or those available through the PASS SA, an
	agreement for recipient audit services is necessary. <a href="#appH">Appendix H</a>
	lists suggested sections to be included in an agreement for recipient audit
	services with references to sections in this guideline, where relevant. This is
	not a comprehensive listing. It is recommended that departmental managers work
	with contracting and procurement staff in developing any agreement for
	recipient audit services. </p><p>Sections 8.1 to 8.2 discuss sections in the agreement
	for recipient audit services not covered elsewhere in this guide.</p><section anchor="8.1" title="8.1 Communications between the department and the recipient"><p>The departmental manager is responsible for
		communicating to the recipient the planned recipient audit and the authority to
		perform the audit. The departmental manager should be sensitive to the needs or
		possible conflicts of the recipient when determining the appropriate timing for
		the recipient audit. This timing, of course, needs to be suitable for the
		recipient, the department and the auditor.</p><p>The departmental manager may also discuss with the recipient the following:</p><ul><li>The purpose of the recipient audit, i.e., an independent assessment to
			provide assurance on the recipient's compliance with the funding agreement;</li><li>Who will be conducting the recipient audit; </li><li>Responsibilities of the recipient during the audit (e.g., availability
			and completeness of financial and non-financial information subject to audit,
			information related to fraud and error, required written assertions related to
			the information, and assistance to the auditor); and</li><li>Whether the recipient will have the opportunity to review and discuss
			recipient audit findings with the auditor or departmental manager and provide
			concurrence.</li></ul><p>After the recipient is made aware of the upcoming
		audit by the departmental manager and an agreement for audit services has been
		signed (if applicable), the auditor can begin to communicate with the recipient
		for audit purposes. </p></section><section anchor="8.2" title="8.2 Communications between the department and the auditor"><p>The departmental manager should maintain contact with
		the auditor throughout the recipient audit process. As per section 6.5.4 of the
		<em>Directive on Transfer Payments</em>, the departmental manager is responsible
		for "communicating to the auditor the scope of the recipient audit to be
		undertaken, standards to be followed, and the nature of the report to be
		provided to the department." At the recipient audit planning stage, the
		departmental manager should advise the auditor of any areas of concern.
		Presumably, the scope of the recipient audit reflects these areas.</p><p>The departmental manager may want to be involved in
		the development and approval of more detailed criteria (as needed) related to
		clauses selected for review in the funding agreement.</p><p>The auditor should discuss with the departmental
		manager recipient audit findings and the draft recipient audit report before
		issuing the final report.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="9" title="9. Recipient Audit Process"><p>The recipient audit process generally has three
	stages: recipient audit planning, execution and reporting. Recipient audit
	quality control should occur throughout all three stages. These stages are
	discussed below.</p><section anchor="9.1" title="9.1 Recipient audit planning"><p>The first step of a recipient audit is recipient audit
		planning. Once an agreement for recipient audit services has been negotiated
		and signed, the auditor begins to plan the recipient audit. During the planning
		stage of a recipient audit, the auditor may review such items as the funding
		agreement, recipient claims and any previous recipient audits. The auditor may
		also meet with the department to discuss areas of concern. It is at this stage
		that the auditor may look at internal controls of the recipient related to the
		funding agreement. A review of internal controls related to the agreement may
		necessitate a visit to the recipient or can be done by other means, such as a
		questionnaire or enquiry. </p><p>Based on issues identified, the auditor determines the
		nature, extent and timing of additional recipient audit procedures. This is
		documented in a planning memorandum, which can include recipient audit
		objectives, recipient audit criteria, recipient audit programs and a sampling
		of transactions. A recipient audit objective is a general statement of the
		expected output of a recipient audit (e.g., to assess the compliance with a
		funding agreement). Recipient audit programs document specific steps that the
		auditor carries out to examine particular areas, such as direct material,
		salaries or labour expenses, overhead, etc. If applicable to the recipient
		audit, a sampling of transactions is the number of items in a population of
		transactions (e.g., direct material) that an auditor reviews. </p></section><section anchor="9.2" title="9.2 Recipient audit execution"><p>The second step of a recipient audit is recipient
		audit execution. The recipient audit is conducted as per the planning
		memorandum with adjustments being made, if further issues become apparent
		during the recipient audit. Recipient audit programs are completed with sampled
		transactions reviewed (if reasonable or high assurance is required). Recipient
		audit work, including evidence related to any errors or observations, is
		documented in recipient audit files (e.g., working papers) at this stage to
		support the conclusion of the recipient audit. </p></section><section anchor="9.3" title="9.3 Recipient audit reporting"><p>The third step of a recipient audit is recipient audit
		reporting. After the execution of the recipient audit, the auditor prepares a
		recipient audit report. Some possible formats of the report are shown in <a href="#appG">Appendix G</a>.</p></section><section anchor="9.4" title="9.4 Recipient audit quality control"><p>Recipient audit quality controls (RAQC) occur throughout
		all three steps above. RAQC are actions or procedures implemented by the
		recipient auditor to ensure that objectives of the engagement have been
		properly and adequately achieved. RAQC should be part of any recipient audit
		and should be in accordance with standards being used by the auditor.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fnr19" title="See footnote 19">19</a></sup> RAQC procedures in a recipient audit may
		include the following:</p><ul><li>Adequate recipient audit planning;</li><li>Adequate competencies of the recipient audit team as well as proper
			supervision, as required;</li><li>Review of engagement working papers for possible outstanding issues,
			adequacy of work and appropriateness of conclusions;</li><li>Ethical requirements regarding independence of auditor, integrity and
			conflict of interest; and</li><li>Possible review of engagement working papers by persons outside of the
			recipient audit team.</li></ul></section></chapter><chapter anchor="10" title="10. Recipient Audit Report Follow-Up and Dissemination"><p>After the completion of the recipient audit report,
	recipient audit report follow-up and dissemination occur. As per the agreement
	for recipient audit services, the auditor provides the departmental manager
	with the recipient audit report. The departmental manager should review the
	recipient audit report and follow up on the results of the recipient audit in a
	timely fashion, based on the significance of findings in the recipient audit
	report. Any identified overpayments to the recipient should be established as
	debt due to the Crown and collected from the recipient. Reasonable unexpended
	balances of advance payments made under terms of a funding agreement and held
	by a recipient at the end of any fiscal year within the term of a multi-year
	funding agreement are not to be considered as repayable at that time.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fnr20" title="See footnote 20">20</a></sup></p><p>Departmental managers may find it useful to analyze
	recipient audit reports for the same transfer payment program to look for
	trends, program deficiencies or efficiencies, and possible future program
	redesign issues. </p><p>The <em>Policy on Transfer Payments </em>and the<em>
	Directive on Transfer Payments</em> do not direct how recipient audit reports
	should be disseminated. Departmental managers may wish to distribute these
	reports to the departmental audit committee, internal audit and evaluation groups,
	the chief financial officer, and others. As appropriate, departments should
	consider developing a recipient audit follow-up protocol for handling recipient
	audit reports, including roles and responsibilities, requirements for
	communicating findings, and managing recipient audit findings. If available,
	the recipient audit follow-up protocol may be included in the departmental
	level risk-based plan. See <a href="#appE">Appendix E</a>.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="11" title="11. Fraud"><p>The appendix of the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15792"><em>Directive on
	Losses of Money or Property</em></a> defines fraud as the following:</p><p class="indent1">Fraud is a criminal deception involving the use of false representation
	with the specific intent of gaining an unfair or dishonest advantage. Fraud
	ordinarily involves either
	wilful misrepresentation or deliberate concealment of material facts for the
	purpose of inducing another person to either part with cash or something else
	of value or to surrender a legal right.</p><p>A recipient audit is generally not designed to detect
	fraud. However, depending on the standards an auditor uses for the engagement,
	an auditor may have certain responsibilities to consider fraud.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fnr21" title="See footnote 21">21</a></sup> Should the auditor detect fraud or
	possible fraud in the audit engagement and inform the department, the
	departmental manager's first step should be to contact departmental legal
	services to determine departmental protocol. As well, it is recommended that
	the chief financial officer's staff be consulted regarding issues such as
	recoveries and receivables.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="12" title="12. Enquiries"><p>This guideline may be updated periodically, as

	ensuring cost-effective oversight and internal control systems to support the
	management of transfer payments. As indicated earlier in this document,
	recipient monitoring, which includes recipient audits, is part of this cost-effective
	oversight. As part of the oversight function and for internal control purposes,
	departments (at any level within the organization) may decide to assess any
	part of the transfer payment management process for some or all of its
	programs. This internal control provides the department with information on how
	well particular aspects of the transfer payment processes are functioning,
	depending on the criteria selected. For example, management may want to
	determine how well departmental managers are following payment terms in the
	funding agreements. This kind of assessment likely involves comparing selected
	payments to recipients to the relevant terms in the funding agreements. Another
	assessment can include visits to recipients to assess whether performance
	objectives, as defined in the funding agreements, are being achieved.</p><p>The sample
	used for this internal control can be selected using various approaches,
	including a stratified sample where high-value or high-risk funding agreements
	are reviewed as well as a random selection from the balance of the funding

	accountability." The report of the Independent Blue Ribbon Panel on Grant and
	Contribution Programs, <em>From Red Tape to Clear Results</em>, dated December
	2006, contained 32 recommendations. The recommendations related to recipient
	audits are as follows:</p><div class="indent1"><h3>Recommendation 6</h3><p>To achieve a "single view of the
		client" the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and concerned departments
		should improve horizontal coordination of program administration within and
		across departments. </p><h3>Recommendation 7</h3><p>The Treasury Board and its
		Secretariat should, to the extent practicable, and in cooperation with other
		orders of government, seek to harmonize federal, provincial and municipal
		information, reporting and audit requirements for grants and contributions.</p><h3>Recommendation 17 </h3><p>The Treasury Board of Canada
		Secretariat should develop a risk management approach for grants and
		contributions that tailors the nature of the oversight and reporting
		requirements to the capacities and circumstances of recipients, and complements
		their existing reporting processes. The panel believes these conditions should
		include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:</p><ul><li>the amount of money involved;</li><li>the complexity of the uses to which the money is to be put (e.g., conditionality);</li><li>the established management credibility and track record of the recipient;</li><li>the sensitivity of the project/program; and</li><li>the size and capacities of the recipient organization.</li></ul><h3>Recommendation 19</h3><p>The Treasury Board of Canada
		Secretariat and departments should encourage and facilitate cross-departmental,
		consolidated audit planning for recipients engaged in projects funded from
		multiple programs. This is especially important in the case of intergovernmental
		contribution agreements. </p><h3>Recommendation 21</h3><p>Recipients should be subject to
		audit by the federal government no more than once a year, regardless of the
		number of funding agreements in place. (Exceptions would apply where a need was
		identified for follow-up action, e.g., forensic audits.)</p><h3>Recommendation 22</h3><p>The Treasury Board should encourage departments to perform a regular series of random audits, based on the annual
		financial cycle of the recipient organization and a department-wide risk assessment of the organization.</p></div></appendix><appendix anchor="D" title="Appendix D: Overview of Types of Audits"><table class="rpp widthFull"><thead><tr class="lightgreyBG"><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><strong>Type of Audit and Purpose</strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><strong>Possible Beneficiaries</strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><strong>Responsible to Initiate </strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><strong>Output or Product</strong></th><th scope="col" class="alignTop"><strong>Use of Product</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Financial Statement Audit</strong>-To

		paragraph-This paragraph states that based on the review of [financial or
